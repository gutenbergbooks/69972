<p class='c006'>A wild and wintry night, in a wild and wintry scene!
The old turnpike road running through the mountain pass,
lonely at the best times, seemed quite deserted now.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old Scotch toll-gate keeper sat shivering over his
blazing hickory wood fire, and listening to the dashing rain
and beating wind that seemed to threaten the destruction
of his rude dwelling.</p>

<p class='c011'>His old wife sat near him, spinning yarn from a small
wheel that she turned with the united action of hand and
foot.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ugh!” shuddered the old man, as a blast fiercer than
ever shook the house, “it ’ill ding down the old dwelling
next, and no harm done! An it were once blown away,
the company would behoove to build us anither strong
enough to stand the storms o’ these parts. Hech! but it’s
awfu’ cold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pit anither log on the fire, gudeman. Wood’s plenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>enough, that’s a blessing,” said the old woman, without
ceasing to turn her wheel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wha’s the use, Jenny? Ye’ll no warm sic an old
place as this. Eh, woman, but whiles my knees are roasting,
my back is freezing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aweel, then gae away to bed wid ye, Andy, and I’ll
tuck ye up warm, and bring ye your hot toddy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay, Jenny, worse luck, I maun sit up to let the bridegroom
through the gate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The bridegroom? Hoot, man! He’ll no pass the
road on sic a wild night as this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will he no, and his bonny bride waiting? Jenny,
woman, what like o’ wind or weather would ha’ stopt me
the day we were gaun to be married? So ye maun gie me
my pipe, gudewife, for I bide here to open the gate for the
blithe bridegroom to pass through.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But he maun see that no tender lassie can take the road
in sic a storm as this, and they were to be married by
special license at nine, and gae away in a grand travelling
carriage at ten, to meet the steamboat at eleven. But that
can no be now, for the rain is comin’ down like Noah’s
flood, and the wind blowing a hurricane, to say naething o’
the roads all being turned into rinning rivers,” argued
Jenny.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be for <i>her</i> to decide whether it can or canna be.
It will be for <i>him</i> to take the road in the worst weather
that ever fell from heaven, if it be to keep his tryst with
his troth-plighted bride. So gie me my pipe, Jenny, for
I’se stop up to let the bridegroom gae by.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He willna come now, and so ye’ll see, gudeman,” said
the wife, as she filled his pipe, and pressed the tobacco well
down into the bowl with her big fore finger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An he does na come through wind or rain or snow, or
ony ither like o’ weather the Lord please to send this
night, and I were Miss Anna Lyon, I’d cast him off in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>morn like old shoes,” nodded Andy, as he took the pipe from
his wife and put it into his mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But don’t ye see, gudeman, that it’ll be nae use. She
<i>canna</i> travel on sic a night as this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m no that sure she will be called upon to travel the
night. I heard a rumor they had changed all that. And
there was to be a grand wedding at the old Hall, and a
hall and a supper, and that the bonny bride and bridegroom
wouldna gae away till the morn. And I’se believe it,”
said Andy, taking the big tongs, picking up a live coal, and
beginning to light his pipe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hoot, man, that will be no decent. She’ll behoove to
marry and gae away like ither brides, but she’ll no be married
and gae away the night. The wedding maun be pit
off,” said Jenny, resuming her place at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pit off! It hae been pit off twice a’ready, once when
the old Judge Lyon died, then when the old lady died. An
it be pit off a third time, it ’ill never take place. But it
will no be put off. He’ll keep his tryst, and she’ll keep her
word. Worse luck that I hae to bide up to let him
through.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An he maun come, pity he could na ha’ come sooner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hoot, gudewife, how could he? The steamer does na
stop at the Stormy Petrel Landing until nigh noon, and it
will be a good fifty miles from here. And he travelling in
his ain carriage without a change of horses all the way over
sic roads, and in sic weather as this? How will he come
sooner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh! but I wish he were here!” cried the old woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There he’ll be now!” exclaimed the old man, rising and
listening, as in a temporary lull of the tempest the sound
of carriage wheels was heard dashing, rumbling and tumbling
along the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take your big shawl about you,” said Jenny, rising
and reaching down a heavy gray “maud” from its peg,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>and throwing it over Andy’s shoulders, as, with a lighted
candle in his hand, he went to open the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hech, sirs! what a night to take the road in! Naething
but a waiting bride should fetch a man forth in sic
weather!” exclaimed the old toll-taker, as a blast of wind
and rain blew out his candle, and whirled his shawl up over
his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shut the door, gudeman, or we’ll both be drowned in
our ain house, and bide a we till I bring ye the lantern.
Ye’ll no be able to take a lighted candle out there,” said
Jenny, as she ran to a corner cupboard and brought forth
an old horn machine big enough for a lighthouse or a watch
tower. She lit the candle end that was in it, and handed
it to Andy.</p>

<p class='c011'>He having meanwhile, fastened his great shawl with several
strong pins and skewers, once more opened the door,
and went forth into the pitch dark night and raging storm.</p>

<p class='c011'>A spacious travelling carriage stood at the toll-gate, with
two crimson lamps glowing luridly through the dark, driving
tempest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Holding down his hat with one hand and carrying the
lantern with the other, old Andy pushed on towards the
carriage, and saw that its door stood open, and a young
man in a heavy travelling cloak was leaning out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be gude to us, sir! is it yoursel’, sure enough? Troth,
I said ye would come,” said Andy, with a welcoming smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come! why, to be sure I would come. Did you think
that any sort of weather would have stopped me on such an
occasion as this? Why, Birney, I would have come if it
had rained pitchforks, points downward, or wild cats and
mad dogs,” laughed the young man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sae I said, sir; sae I said!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Birney, my friend, I must get out and stretch my
limbs a little. I want to be able to stand when I get to the
Hall; but really, I have been cramped up in this close carriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>so many hours, riding over this beast of a country so
many miles, without seeing a single place where I could
stop for refreshment, that—that—in short, Birney, you
must let me out and let me in,” said the traveller.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely, Mr. Alexander! surely, sir! and much honor to
my humble home,” said the old toll-taker, smiling, and
bowing respectfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man, notwithstanding his “cramped” condition,
leaped lightly from his carriage, drew his travelling cloak
closely around him, hoisted a large umbrella, and unceremoniously
preceded his host to the house, where he burst
suddenly in upon Jenny, who was in the act of taking a
kettle of boiling water from the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gude save us! Mr. Alick, is it yoursel’? I could hardly
believe ony gentleman in his sober sinses would take the
road on sic a night!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is myself, Mistress Birney—that I know; but as to
being in my sober senses, I am not quite so sure. I see
you’ve got some hot water there. I hope you have also got
a sample of that fine old Scotch whiskey your husband
used to drink in remembrance of your old country. If so,
Mistress Birney, I’ll thank you to make me a tumbler of
hot toddy. It would be very acceptable in such weather as
this,” said “Mr. Alick,” as he threw off his cloak and his
cap, and dropped himself down into old Andy’s own arm-chair,
in the warm chimney corner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely, sir! surely, Mr. Alick! I’se make it directly.
I’se e’en now just gaun to mix the gude man’s night drink
for himsel’,” smiled Jenny, hospitably.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right! mix mine at the same time,” said the young
man, stretching out his feet to the fire, and indulging in a
great yawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And mix it in the big stone pitcher with the zinc cover,
so it will keep hot while we sit and drink the bonny bride,
Miss Anna Lyon’s health,” said old Andy as he came in
and closed the door to keep out the driving rain.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“Oh, look here! You know I’ve no time for health-drinking;
I’m due at the Hall these three hours; only this
horrid weather, and these beastly roads have delayed me,”
exclaimed Mr. Alick, rising impatiently and standing before
the blazing fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a very good-looking young fellow, as he stood
there. He had a tall, well-proportioned form, fine regular
features, a fair, roseate complexion, light yellow hair, and
bright blue eyes—smiling eyes that seemed to love all they
looked upon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Quickly and skilfully Jenny Birney made the toddy and
poured it into large tumblers that she had previously heated
by scalding them out with boiling water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once more Mr. Alick dropped himself into old Andy’s
chair, while he received one of the glasses from his host.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh, there sir; it’s as hot as love!” said the old man,
as he passed the pitcher that his guest might replenish his
glass at his pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is very good,” admitted the young man when he had
finished his second tumbler. “Many thanks to you,
Mistress Birney for the aid and comfort you have given me.
I feel as if you had saved my life. I can now do the distance
between this and the Hall without breaking down.
And now I must be off. Good evening to you, Mistress
Birney.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the traveller put on his cloak and cap, took up his
umbrella, and escorted by Andy, left the cottage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, by the way, Birney, you may bring out some of
that hot stuff to my coachman. Poor devil! it will do him
no harm after he has been perched up there so long in the
rain. But hark ye, Birney! don’t let it be too stiff; I
don’t want the fellow to see more mists before his eyes than
the night and the storm make,” said Mr. Alick as he got
into the carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Andy toddled back to his house, and after a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>minutes reappeared at the carriage with a mug of the
same restorative for the man as he had lately administered
to the master.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chilled and wearied coachman turned it down his
throat almost at a gulp, returned the mug, and thanked the
donor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he gathered up his reins, cracked his whip, and
started his horses at as brisk a trot as might be deemed
safe on that dark night over that rough road.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old turnpike-keeper hurried out of the storm into
the shelter of his own cottage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hech! it’s an awfu’ night! I’m glad he’s come and
gone. We may pit up the shutters now, gudewife; we’ll
no be troubled wi’ ony more travellers the night,” said old
Andy, as he shook his shawl free from the clinging rain
drops, and hung it up in its place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now sit ye down in your own comfortable chair, gudeman,
and I’ll brew ye a bowl o’ hot punch. Eh, hinney,
ye’ll be needing it after sic’ an exposure to the elements,”
said Jenny, as she replaced the kettle over the blaze, and
drew Andy’s old arm-chair before the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a sigh of infinite relief, he let himself sink into the
inviting seat, kicked off his heavy shoes, and stretched his
stockinged feet to the genial warmth of the hearth. Andy
did not rejoice in the luxury of a pair of slippers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh, Jenny, woman, it’s good to feel oneself at ease at
one’s own fireside at last,” said the old man, as he took from
the hand of his wife a smoking tumbler of punch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘It’s hot as love,’ as you say,” she nodded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh, so it is; what’s the hour, gudewife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s gone weel on to ten,” she answered, glancing at
the tall old clock that stood in the corner, and reached from
floor to ceiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I’se gaun to bed immediately, no to be bothered
wi’ any more travellers the night,” said Andy, blowing and
sipping his punch.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>But Andy reckoned without his host, as many of his
betters do.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just at that moment there came a rap at the door, so low,
however, that it could scarcely be heard amid the roaring of
the storm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet both husband and wife turned and listened.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s that?” asked Andy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s some one outside,” said Jenny.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rap was reiterated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who the de’il can it be, at this unlawful hour o’ the
night? Gae see, Jenny, woman. And if it’s ony vagrants
bang the door in their faces. I’se no be troubled wi’ ony
more callers the night!” cried the old man, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he had well done grumbling, the old woman had
gone to the door and opened it, letting in a furious blast of
wind and rain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gude guide us!” she exclaimed, starting back, aghast,
at what she saw without.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What the de’il is it then, gude wife?” nervously
demanded Andy, starting up and seizing his old musket
from its hooks above the chimney-piece. Andy was thinking
only of thieves, as is usual with many who have little
to lose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pit up your gun, gude man, it’s no what ye think,”
said Jenny, once more approaching the door to peep out at
the wretch that stood dripping and shivering outside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the love of Heaven, let me in a little while. I will
not stay many minutes,” pleaded a plaintive voice from the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is it?” inquired Andy, coming cautiously forward
in his stocking feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s some poor lassie, as far as I can make out. Come
in wi’ ye then,” said Jenny, stretching the door wide open,
though the wind and the rain rushed in, flooding the floor
where they stood.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Ay, come in, and ye maun, and dinna stand there like
a lunatic keeping the door open and letting in the weather,”
growled Andy, as he toddled back to his comfortable chair
and dropped into it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he had half uttered his churlish invitation, the
stranger had entered, and now stood in the room, with the
rain running from her dark raiment, while Jenny shut and
bolted the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now then, who are ye? and what brings ye tramping
on sic a night as this?” sternly demanded Andy, as he
turned and stared at the stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wore a long dark gray cloak with a hood; the cloak
completely concealed her form and its hood overshadowed
her face. That was all that Andy could make of her appearance
then.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are ye, I ask, and where are ye gaun the night,”
he angrily repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stranger did not answer except by dropping her face
upon her open hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Andy, dinna ye see she canna speak? For the sake of
our own poor lost Katie, we maun have pity. Come away
to the fire, my poor lass, and dry your clothes, whiles I get
ye something warm to take the chill out o’ your poor shivering
body,” said Jenny, kindly placing her hand upon the
girl’s shoulder and gently urging her towards the fire-place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m of opinion that ye’d better find out who she is, and
where she came from, and where she’s gaun, before ye press
upon her the hospitalities of an honest house,” grumbled
Mr. Birney.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whist, gude man! I might speer a dizzen questions,
but dinna ye see for yoursel’ that she’s in na condition to
answer ane?” said Jenny, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Andy growled something in which the words “tramping
hizzy” were the only ones audible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, let me hae your cloak, hinny, to hang it up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>dry. See, it’s wringing wet. Nay, nay, dinna resist gude
offices,” said Mrs. Birney, with kind persistence, as she
saw that the girl made some little, mute, pathetic resistance
to the removal of her outer garment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jenny gently took it off her and hung it on the back of
a chair to dry by the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the young stranger stood revealed in all her loveliness
and sorrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was a young, slight, graceful creature, with a thin,
pale face, dark hair and dark eyebrows, long, black eye-lashes,
and large, soft, gray eyes, so full of pleading sadness
that their glances went straight to the heart of Jenny
Birney. It was a child’s face; but ah, woe! it was a
matron’s form revealed there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wae-sooks!” exclaimed the good wife in consternation,
as she gazed upon the young thing, and saw that, child-like
as she looked, she had been married, or——ought to have
been.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the little, pale hands went up and covered the
little, woe-forn face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sit ye down,” said Mrs. Birney, kindly. “Ye are no
able to stand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she drew her own low, cushioned chair to the
chimney corner, and with gentle force pushed the poor
child into it. And then she took down her little black tea-pot
from the corner cupboard and began to make tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Birney watched the process in strong disapprobation.</p>

<p class='c011'>His wife raised a deprecating glance to his face, murmuring,
in a low tone:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We maun be pitiful, Andy! for our poor lost Katy’s
sake, we maun be pitiful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He answered that appeal by growling forth the words:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aweel, aweel, Jenny woman, hae your ain way! hae
your ain way! Eh! but ye’ve had it these forty years and
mair! And it’s no likely that ye’ll gie it up now!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>And so saying, the old man put his pipe in his mouth
and resigned himself to circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Birney made a cup of tea and a round of toast, and
set them on a little stand beside her guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now eat and drink and ye’ll be better. Nay, nay,
dinna shake your poor little head! do as I bid ye. I had a
child o’ my ain once. She has been in heaven, I hope,
these twenty years. Sae ye see I hae a soft place in my
heart for children, especially for lassies; sae eat and drink,
and be comforted and strengthened, and then maybe ye’ll
tell me how ye came to be out in the weather, and what I
can do for ye besides giving you a bit and sup and a bed to
lie on,” coaxed the good woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks, thanks,” murmured the girl, as she raised the
cup, and with a feverish thirst eagerly drank the tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Try some of the toast. It is done with milk; it will
nourish ye,” hospitably urged Jenny.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please—I cannot eat a morsel, and—I must go now,”
answered the young stranger, rising.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go now! Are ye daft?” exclaimed Mrs. Birney, in
dismay; while Mr. Birney took the pipe from his mouth
and stared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I am not ‘daft,’ though I know how mad my purpose
must seem,” calmly answered the girl, taking her
cloak from the chair upon which it was drying by the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—I thought ye came here for a night’s lodging,
and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no; I had no such design,” sighed the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—an ye didna come for a night’s lodging, what <i>did</i>
ye come for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was nearly spent with struggling on in the face of the
tempest. I was so beaten by the wind and the rain that I
thought I should have dropped and died; I almost wish I
had. But I saw the light in your window and I tried to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>reach it, and I did. I came in only to rest and breathe a
little while, and get strength to go on again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But where did ye come from, my poor child?” inquired
the pitying woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I came from Washington by the stage-coach. It put
me down at the Cross Roads, ten miles from this place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gude save us! and ye walked all that way through the
storm?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and was nearly exhausted; but now, thanks to
your charity, I feel refreshed, and able to pursue my
journey,” said the young girl, as she tied her cloak, and
drew its hood over her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, then, and ye’ll no do onything o’ the sort. Eh,
sirs, are we heathen to let a wee bit lassie gae forth alane
on sic a stormy winter-night as this, when we wouldna turn
an enemy’s dog from the door? Sit ye down, my lass, and
dinna ye mind the gudeman’s growling. His bark is aye
worse than his bite,” said Mrs. Birney.</p>

<p class='c011'>And here Mr. Birney took his pipe from his mouth, and
spoke these gracious words:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bide ye here for the present, an’ ye will. I dinna like
tramps as a permanent institution in the house, but I’ll no
turn ye out into the storm, sae bide where ye be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And having uttered this oracle, old Andy replaced his
pipe between his lips, and smoked vigorously to make up
for lost time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye hear what the gudeman says? Hark ye now to the
wisdom of age, and bide ye quiet till I make ye a bed, and
I’ll wrap ye weel and pit ye warm to sleep the night, and
in the morn ye may gae where ye like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks—a thousand thanks for your dear mercy! but
in the morning it will be too late. Ah, heaven, yes!”
exclaimed the girl, as a sudden terror wildly dilated her
large gray eyes. “I must go on to-night, or fail, where
failure would be despair and death!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Gae on to-night! Gude save us! gae on where?”
exclaimed the wondering woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Old Lyon Hall,” answered the stranger, moving
towards the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stay—come back! Ye are stark daft! To the
Hall?” cried Jenny, following her guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, to the old Hall,” said the stranger, pausing courteously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, that’s where the grand wedding will be the
night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it,” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—ye’ll surely no be one o’ the invited guests?”
exclaimed Jenny in bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no,” replied the girl, with a strange smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look ye, lass. Who be ye? What be your name, an
ye have no objection to tell it?” gravely inquired Mrs.
Birney.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no objection to tell my name; it has never been
sullied by dishonor; it is Anna Lyon,” replied the girl,
with her hand upon the door-latch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Anna Lyon!</span> Sign us, and save us! that is the name
of the bride that is to be married to-night!” cried Jenny
Birney, aghast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it is,” quietly replied the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And ye hae the same name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The very same,” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gude save us! then ye’ll be kin to the family?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no kin,” answered the girl, calmly. Then to herself
she murmured, “<i>I</i>—‘a little more than kin,’ <i>he</i> ‘a
little less than kind.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are ye muttering to yoursel’? Ye say ye’re no
kin to the family, and if ye are no, what will be taking you
to the old Hall the night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something more than a matter of life and death!
And oh, I must be gone!” said the girl, with the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>look of terror that she had shown once before, now smiting
all the remaining color from her pale face, and leaving it
white as marble.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-bye—good-bye, and a thousand heart-felt thanks
for all your kindness,” she added.</p>

<p class='c011'>While she spoke she deftly slid the bolts of the door, and
as she ceased she quickly slipped through it, and ran away
like one who feared to be hindered or pursued.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stop! stop!” screamed Jenny, rushing after her, and
looking out into the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>But her strange visitor had vanished in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hech! she’s clean daft, and she’ll perish in the storm!”
cried Jenny in consternation, as she drew in her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come away, gudewife, and shut the door!” bawled old
Andy, provoked past his patience.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh, gude man, rin—rin after her. Ye may catch her
an ye start now,” prayed Jenny, pulling down her husband’s
shawl from its peg, and throwing it over his shoulders—“rin,
rin for your life, Andy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“De’il be in my legs, then, if I budge a foot from the
fire! I’m in a condition to rin, am I no? wi’ both my
shoes off and mysel’ soaking wi’ sweat! I’ll no rin for ony
daft lass or lad in Christendom!” grumbled the old man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But for the Lord’s sake, Andy!” pleaded the woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would do onything in reason for the Lord’s sake, an’
He distinctly called me, but I’m no conscious of any
special call to pit myself forward in this work. Sae just
shut up the house, Jenny, woman, and come away to bed.
And I’ll no open again this night to man or woman, saint
or devil, so there, now!” growled old Andy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’se shut the door, but I’se nae shut the window. And
I’se no gaun to bed this night, I’se sit up and show a light,
if the poor wandering lassie behooves to come back,” said
Mrs. Birney, firmly, as she fastened the door, and sat the
lantern on the little stand under the window, with the light
turned towards the road.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“The more fool you,” observed Mr. Birney, as he began
to draw off his stockings, and prepare himself for his bed,
that stood conveniently near, in a recess curtained off from
the other portion of the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Birney drew her spinning wheel to the chimney
corner nearest the window, where she had placed the light,
and she sat down and began to spin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye’ll no be whirling that machine and keeping me
awake, Jenny, woman!” expostulated the old man as he
got into bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if I maun sit up, I maun na lose my time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then knit or sew.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She good-humoredly put aside her wheel and took from
the top of the corner cupboard her work-basket half filled
with woolen socks, which she sat down to darn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Andy was soon snoring under his blankets.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jenny sat darning and sighing, and occasionally peering
through the window into the darkness without. The violence
of the storm seemed to be subsiding, though still it
rained heavily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s like murder,” she murmured. “And, if she be
found cold and dead in the morn I shall never forgi’e
mysel’. I shall never be able to sleep again. Eh! but I
wish I had rin out after her mysel.’ But then the
gudeman would na hae let me. Hech! but they get hard
and selfish wi’ age and infirmities, these men. Eh! how he
sleeps and snores, as if there was no misery in the world,”
she added, glancing at the bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the old curmudgeon’s rest was destined to be
broken.</p>

<p class='c011'>There came the sound of horse’s hoofs dashing along the
flooded road. The toll-gate bar was cleared at a bound.
Jenny heard the spring and splash, and she started to her
feet, dropping her work-basket.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next moment there came a loud rapping at the door.
It aroused the old man from his sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“What the de’il is that?” he exclaimed, angrily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s ane without,” whispered Jenny, in a scared
tone, trembling in spite of herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Worse luck! Is it a Witch’s Sabbath and are all the
warlocks and witches riding to it by this road the night?”
he growled.</p>

<p class='c011'>The knocking grew louder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is it, Jenny?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dinna know,” whispered the woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Canna ye gae and see?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The knocking became vociferous, the horseman seemed
to be hammering at the door with the loaded end of his
riding-whip.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Haud your noise out there, will you then!” bawled the
old man, bouncing out of bed, throwing a blanket around
him and seizing his blunderbus, while Jenny crept to the
door and cautiously opened it, keeping herself behind it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rain had nearly ceased and the sky was clearing.</p>

<p class='c011'>A tall, stout, dark man, in a dark riding-coat, stood outside.
With one hand he held the bridle of his horse, and
with the other the handle of his riding-whip, with which
he had just rapped.</p>

<p class='c011'>So much Jenny, cautiously peeping around the edge of
the door, could make out.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old toll-taker came forward, wrapped in his blanket
like a North American Indian, and carrying his musket in
his hand, and growling:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Am I no to have ony peace or quiet the night? I’d as
weel be keeper o’ one o’ these new-fangled railway stations
where the trains are aye coming and going day and night,
instead o’ this once quiet toll-gate. Who be ye, sir, and
what’s your will?” he growled at this second stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am a traveller going to Old Lyon Hall; and I wish
to know the nearest road,” answered the horseman. But a
sudden parting blast of wind drowned half his words.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“And by the way, how came ye on this side of the road,
when the great bar is up for the night?” angrily demanded
the toll-taker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my horse took it at a bound.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An he had broken your neck it might hae been a gude
job and saved the hangman trouble,” growled old Andy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks,” laughed the stranger, “but there was not a
chance of it; my horse is a famous hunter. Will you direct
me on my road?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Where</i> did you say you were going?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Old Lyon Hall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Old Lyon Hall!—Jenny, woman, here is anither
one! It’s <i>there</i> they are holding the witches’ dance and
no wedding, for the warlocks and witches that flit by this
way are no wedding guests,” said the old man, turning to
his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you be so good as to direct me to the Hall?”
courteously persisted the traveller.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ay, I’ll direct ye fast enough; but be ye’ one o’ the
wedding guests?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not exactly,” laughed the man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hark to him Jenny! how much he talks like the ither
one! Then what’s your business at the Hall the night? It’s
unco late to make a visit, and varry oncivil to go oninvited
where they’re handing a bridal. Wouldna the morn serve
your turn just as weel?” mockingly inquired Andy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; the morning would be too late for my purpose. It
is of the utmost importance that I should reach the Hall to-night!”
said the horseman, beginning to grow restive under
the influence of some hidden anxiety that he could not entirely
conceal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it an affair of ‘life and death?’” inquired Andy,
with a touch of sarcasm in his tone, as he repeated the
words that had been used by the unhappy girl who had preceded
this stranger on this road.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“More—much more than life and death is involved,”
muttered the traveller, in a voice vibrating with the agitation
that he could no longer control.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hark to him again, Jenny!” grinned the old man.
“Just the way the ither one talked. The de’il maun be
holding a levee at the Hall!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg you will not detain me; pray put me on my
road,” impatiently urged the stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ay! ye see the road before ye. Ye’ll just face it
and follow your nose, and it will lead to the old Hall. Ye
canna miss it. It stands off about a quarter mile from the
road, on the right. There’s woods before it, and the Porcupine
Mountains behind it. It will be the first grand like
mansion ye’ll come to, and the only one, an’ ye were to ride
a hunder miles in that direction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks,” said the stranger, lifting his cap and remounting
his horse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And oh, kind gentleman,” said Jenny, coming forward,
“an’ ye should meet wi’ a poor daft lassie who gaed before
on the same road, ye’ll no let her perish for the want of a
helping hand. For the love of the Lord, ye’ll get her
under shelter or bring her back here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘A poor daft lassie,’” repeated the stranger, bewildered
by the woman’s words and manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, sir; a poor bit child wha canna guide hersel’ to ony
gude end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A young tramp, sir,” explained the old man. “A
young tramp who passed this way an hour ago; and ye
should get her pit into a House of Correction, ye might be
doing her good service.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no time to stop, but if I should see the young
woman I will do what I can for her. Good night,” said the
traveller, putting spurs to his horse, and galloping away as
if determined not to be detained another moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell you what, Jenny, there’s something unco wrong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>up at the old Hall! And now shut up the house and come
away to bed,” said old Andy, turning from the door, and
dragging his blanket behind him like a court train.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I couldna sleep a wink wi’out hearing what becomes o’
that poor houseless child. I’ll sit up and sew, and show a
light i’ the window, in case she behooves to come back
again,” replied Mrs. Birney, replacing the lantern on the
stand before the window, resuming her seat on her low chair
in the chimney corner, and taking up her work, while the
old man, for the last time that night, shut up the house and
went to bed.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Old Lyon Hall lay at the foot of the Porcupine, an offshoot
of the Alleghanies, in one of the wildest and most
picturesque counties in Virginia.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was built in the Tudor style of domestic architecture,
very irregularly, with many gable ends, gothic windows and
twisted chimneys. Its walls of old red sandstone contrasted
gloomily with the dark hue of the evergreen trees that
bristled up above it, and gave the mountain its descriptive
name.</p>

<p class='c011'>Heavy woods, bare, gray crags, and tumbling torrents
surrounded it, and gave a savage and sombre aspect to the
scene. Below the Hall a turbulent little river, spanned by
a rustic bridge, rushed and roared along its rocky bed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The Hall was very old. It had been built nearly two
hundred years ago by a Scotchman named Saul Sauvage
Lyon, who had received a grant of the land from James the
First. It had remained ever since in the family of the
founder, whose descendants had frequently distinguished
themselves, as soldiers, or statesmen, in every epoch of the
country’s history, either as a colony or a commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some few years since, being the date of this story, the
master of the Old Lyon Hall and Manor was General
Leonard Lyon, a retired army officer, and a veteran of the
war of eighteen hundred and twelve.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon had married very early in his youth, and
had enjoyed many years of calm domestic happiness. But
now his wife and children were all dead, and his only living
descendant was his grandchild, the beautiful Anna Lyon,
“sole daughter of ‘his’ house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Added to the great sorrow of bereavement was vexation,
that, for the want of male heirs, his old family estate must
at last “fall to the distaff.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But there might be found a remedy to this lesser evil.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon had a younger brother, Chief Justice
Lyon, of Richmond. And the chief justice had an only
son.</p>

<p class='c011'>Young Alexander Lyon was a bright, handsome, attractive
lad, a few years older than his cousin Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under all the circumstances, if it was not perfectly
proper, it was at least natural and pardonable that old General
Lyon should wish his grand-daughter to become the wife
of his nephew, so that while she inherited his estate, she
might perpetuate his name.</p>

<p class='c011'>Quite early in the childhood of the boy and girl, the general
proposed their betrothal to the chief justice, who
eagerly acceded to the plan. And so the affair was settled—by
the parents. It was not considered necessary to consult
the children.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Alexander was sent to Yale College, where, for a few
years, he led rather a fast life for a student.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Anna was placed at a fashionable boarding school in
New York, where she had a great deal more liberty than
was good for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twice a year the young persons were permitted to meet—when
they spent the midsummer vacation at old Lyon
Hall, where the chief justice and his wife also came on a
visit to the general, and when they kept the Christmas
holidays at the splendid town house of the chief justice at
Richmond, where the general also went to pay back his
brother’s visit. This arrangement was of course very
agreeable to all parties.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as the boy and girl grew towards manhood and
womanhood, it was thought well to change this routine.
And so, sometimes in the midsummer vacation, the whole
party, consisting of both families, would go for a tour
through the most attractive places of summer resort. And
at Christmas they would keep the holidays in Washington.</p>

<p class='c011'>On all these occasions the young lady and gentleman,
under the auspices of their elders, entered very freely into
the fashionable amusements of the season, with the understanding,
however, that they were not to fall in love, or
even to flirt with any one but each other.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Lyon and Mr. Alexander seemed at first to have no
particular objection to this arrangement. They had always
been fond of each other, much fonder than of any one else.
But ah! theirs was not the love that would excuse, much
less justify marriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been said that when two persons of like complexion
and temperament intermarry, wise nature and
sacred love have had nothing to do with the union. And
the truth spoken to-day is as old as the creation of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna and Alexander were of the same complexion and
the same temperament; both were plump, fair, blue-eyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and yellow-haired, both lively and fond of pleasure, and
both, on the surface, and in matters of little moment, were
amiable and yielding, but below the surface, and in affairs of
importance, resolute and determined as destiny and death.
In person and in character they were as much alike as
twin brother and sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>This similarity, while it made their association as relatives
very agreeable, utterly precluded the possibility of
their becoming lovers, in the common sense of the word.
They did not know this, when their hearts were entirely
free from any other attachment that might have awakened
their consciousness.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no immediate hurry about the projected
marriage. It was certain to take place, the parents concluded,
and so they neither worried themselves nor their
children prematurely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander had to finish his college course, to graduate
and to make the “grand tour,” as was usual with young
gentlemen of his position.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he should have accomplished all this, he would be
about twenty-three years of age and his bride elect would
be about eighteen—both quite young enough to marry, the
old folks argued.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plan was partly carried out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander Lyon graduated with honors and embarked
for Europe. He travelled over quite a considerable portion
of the Eastern Continent. He was gone two years, at the
end of which he returned to claim his promised bride.</p>

<p class='c011'>Active preparations were made for the marriage. But
fate seemed to be against it. A few days before the one
set apart for the ceremony, while the whole of both families
were assembled at Old Lyon Hall to do honor to the
occasion, Chief Justice Lyon was suddenly struck dead by
apoplexy. Instead of a wedding there was a funeral, and
the family went into mourning for a year.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>At the end of that time preparations were again made
for the marriage, which was again arrested by the hand of
death.</p>

<p class='c011'>A malignant fever was prevailing, and Mrs. Lyon, the
widow of the chief justice, was one of its first victims.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, at the close of this second term of mourning
and seclusion, the household awoke as from a nightmare
dream and busied itself with blithe bridal affairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The splendid city mansion and the fine old country house
of the late chief justice were both renovated and refurnished
in costly style for the reception of the new mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was settled that the marriage should take place early
in November. In accordance with the old-time prejudices
of General Lyon, it was to be solemnized, in the evening,
in the great drawing-room of Old Lyon Hall, in the presence
of a large party of friends, who were afterwards to be
entertained with a ball and supper. The bride and groom
were to leave the next morning for a short tour, after which
they were to go to Richmond and settle down for the
winter in their town house, where they were to be joined
by the general.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the arrangement. But “man proposes and”—you
know the rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>The autumn weather that had been glorious with the
“excess of glory” in a genial, refulgent and prolonged
Indian Summer, suddenly changed. The wedding-day
dawned threateningly. No sun shone on it. Heavy black
clouds darkened the sky; wild, mournful winds wailed
through the woods; violent gusts of rain dashed suddenly
down at intervals and as suddenly ceased.</p>

<p class='c011'>The inmates of the old Hall watched the weather in hope
and fear. Would it clear up? Or would it grow worse?
they asked themselves and each other. Certainly there was
no sign of its clearing; quite the contrary, for as the day
declined the storm thickened.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Fires were kindled in every room of the old house.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the great drawing-room the two broad fire-places, one
at each end, were piled high with huge hickory logs, that
were burning and blazing and filling the long room with
glowing light and genial warmth, all the more comfortable
and delightful in contrast to the tempestuous weather without—shining
on the tall brass andirons and fender; shining
on the polished oak floor, with its rich Turkey rugs laid
before each fire-place and sofa; shining on the wainscotted
walls with their time-honored family portraits; shining on
the bright black walnut furniture; and on every surface
and point that could reflect a ray of light.</p>

<p class='c011'>This fine old-fashioned drawing-room was as yet vacant,
waiting for the evening crowd of wedding guests, if indeed
the state of the weather and the roads should permit them
to assemble.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fires were kindled in the long dining-room, where a
sumptuous supper was laid out for the expected company;
and in all the bed-chambers which had been opened and
aired, cleaned and decorated for such of the guests as
should come from a distance, and need to change their
dress and perhaps to lie down and rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>In one of the most spacious and comfortable of these
upper-chambers, late in the afternoon of this day, sat the
bride elect.</p>

<p class='c011'>She reclined in an easy chair, with her feet upon the
fender and her eyes fixed moodily, dreamily upon the glowing
fire before her, and listened to the beating storm without.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here in this room, also, the ruddy blaze shone on dark
wainscotted walls, relieved by crimson damask window curtains,
and on a polished oaken floor, bare of carpets,
except for the rugs that lay upon the hearth before the
dressing-table and beside the bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was indeed a lonely, silent, sombre scene in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>to find a maiden on her bridal evening. The tempest
raged without, and the wind and rain beat against the
walls and windows as if they would batter them down. In
the pauses of the storm she could hear the rushing of the
swollen torrents and the roaring of the rising river. She
knew that the roads must be almost impassable and the
streams unfordable. In truth, no one had bargained for
such weather on the wedding-day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the hundred and fifty guests who had been invited,
not one had yet appeared; not one of her bridesmaids; not
the minister who was to perform the marriage ceremony;
not even her bridegroom! And yet all these had been expected
at an early hour of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everything was ready for their reception and for the
rites and festivals of the evening. Every nook and corner
of the genial old home smiled its welcome in anticipation of
the arrival of these expected guests; and yet not one of
them came.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor, when she listened to the howling of the tempest
without, could the young bride elect wonder at their
absence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her rich and varied wardrobe and her rare and costly
jewels were all packed in half a dozen large travelling-trunks
that stood ready for removal outside her chamber
door in the upper hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her wedding-dress of rich white velvet, her large veil of
fine lace, her wreath of orange-flowers, and all the accessories
of her bridal costume lay out upon the bed. Yet she
doubted that she should be called to wear them that night:
and she sat still gazing into the fire, listening to the storm,
and making no motion towards her toilet.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked a beautiful young creature as she sat there,
with her graceful form, her perfect features, her pure complexion,
her soft blue eyes and pale yellow hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of what was she dreaming as she sat gazing into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>fire, and heaving deep, heavy sighs? Surely not only of
the storm and the trifling delay of her marriage, for she
must have known that it could only be a question of a few
hours, and that whoever might stay away, her bridegroom
would certainly keep his appointment. What serious
subject of thought had she? what <i>possible</i> subject of grief?
Idlest with youth, health and beauty, with high birth,
great wealth and many accomplishments, about to form
the most brilliant marriage of the year, with a gentleman
who seemed her equal in all respects, if not her superior
in some, about to preside over the most splendid
establishment in the city and the grandest old house in the
country, and to reign everywhere a queen in society, what
imaginable cause of discontent could she have?</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah, friends! did ever any of these things, in themselves
alone, satisfy the hunger of any human heart—make any
living creature happy?</p>

<p class='c011'>The darling daughter, the rich heiress, the beautiful
bride elect, sat and sighed and gazed, and gazed and sighed
as if her heart would break.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were secrets in the life of this motherless girl unknown
to her nearest relatives, unsuspected by her appointed
bridegroom. Of that more hereafter.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sat there without moving until dark afternoon deepened
into black night, and the raging of the storm became
terrific. How long she would have sat thus I do not know,
for just as the little toy of a clock upon her mantle-piece
chimed nine her door opened, and her own maid, Matty,
entered the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told you not to bring lights until I should ring for
them,” said Miss Lyon, impatiently turning her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know, Miss Anna; I didn’t bring no lights. I come
to tell you how Marse Alesander has jus’ arroved.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has come—and through all this storm?” exclaimed
Anna in a startled voice.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Yes, Miss, which Old Marse as’ed if you was ready,
and sent me up to ’quire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can be ready soon, Matty. But—has any one else
come?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not the minister?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The which, Miss?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Reverend Doctor Barbar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I don’t see the use of my disturbing myself yet
awhile. There can be no marriage without a minister,”
said the bride elect, with something very much like a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may go, Matilda,” she added to the girl, who still
lingered at the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>Matty vanished, and Miss Lyon resigned herself to her
reverie.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few minutes passed, and Matty reappeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What now?” demanded the young lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please, Miss, ole Marse have sent Jacob, with the close
carriage, to fetch the min’s’er, and say he will be here in
half an hour if you will get ready.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Matty, where is your master?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In his study, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Mr. Alexander?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s gone up to his own room, Miss, to fix hisself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well,” said the young lady, as she arose and left
her chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>She passed up the broad upper hall that was now ruddy
and cheerful with the light of many fires, that shone
through the open doors of the waiting bedrooms, and she
went straight to the little room with the bay window, at
the front end, over the main entrance.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>She opened the door and found her grandfather seated
in his big arm-chair by his writing table, on which lay
books, papers, pens, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the old gentleman was neither reading nor writing.
He was simply sitting and waiting.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a very fine-looking old man, tall and stout, with
a full face, noble features, fair complexion, and snow white
hair and beard. He wore an evening dress of black broadcloth,
with a white vest and white cravat. His white
gloves lay beside him, ready for use.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All alone, gran’pa?” inquired Anna, smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, my pet—yes, my darling,” said the old gentleman,
rising and handing his grand-daughter to a seat with as
much courtesy as if she were a princess. “But why are
you not dressed, Anna? It is late, very late.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, gran’pa, what an awful night for a wedding! And
there is no one here, and no one likely to come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, my dear, but it is the night appointed, and your
bridegroom is in the house, and the minister will soon be
here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gran’pa,” pleaded Anna, leaving her seat and coming
and sitting on his knee, and putting her arm caressingly
around his neck—“dear gran’pa, I cannot bear to be married
under these evil auspices, without witnesses, without
bridesmaids, and on a dark night and in a heavy storm.
Why cannot the marriage be deferred until to-morrow
morning? What difference can a few hours make? At
least, what difference that is not very desirable? By to-morrow
the storm will be over. The ceremony can be performed
early in the morning. I can be married in my
travelling dress. The supper will do for a breakfast. And
we can start immediately upon our wedding tour. Say,
gran’pa, may not the marriage be deferred until the morning?
It is awful to be married in solitude, on a dark,
stormy night. Say, dear gran’pa! <i>May</i> not the marriage
be put off until the morning?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“My dear, no; it cannot be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—why not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For many reasons. For one—Anna, I confess, old
soldier as I am, to a little superstition on some subjects.
This marriage has been already put off <i>twice</i>. If it should
be put off a third time, it will never take place. A marriage
thrice deferred never comes to pass. There, my child,
go and dress. It is nine o’clock. You are two hours
behind time. Alexander is nearly ready, and the minister
will be here in a few minutes,” said the old gentleman,
rising and gently leading his favorite out of the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘A marriage thrice deferred never comes to pass.’ I
wish <i>I</i> was sure of that, and could defer mine just <i>once</i>
more,” mused Anna, as she went back to her room. “And
yet,” she added, compunctiously, “that is unjust and ungrateful
to Alexander. Poor Alick! I dare say, in all these
years, he has never even dreamed of any other girl but me,
while I—while I—Ah, Heaven have pity on us! Well,
well, I will bury the past deep in forgetfulness, and I will
try to make him a good wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When she reached her room she found Matty and
Matty’s mother, Marcy, who was her own old nurse, in attendance.
The fire was mended, the hearth swept and the
lamps lighted. The two on her dressing-table shone down
upon an open casket of jewels that blazed with blinding
radiance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna went wearily up to look at them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mars’ Alic sent them in by his man, honey,” said Aunt
Jenny in explanation.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a splendid set of diamonds, consisting of ear-rings,
breastpin, necklace and bracelets.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will wear them, honey, dough dere ain’t anybody
to see them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Except the giver! Yes, auntie, I will wear them.
Poor Alick!” sighed Anna, sitting down on her dressing-stool,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>and resigning herself into the hands of her attendants.</p>

<p class='c011'>They went willingly to work. The task of arranging
their mistress for her bridal was with them a labor of love.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Marcy standing behind the chair brushed and braided
the beautiful hair. Young Matty on the floor, encased the
dainty feet in silken hose and satin slippers. And then
the beauty stood up and let them remove her wrapper and
put on her robes and her wreath, and her veil. But with
her own hands she clasped the diamond necklace around
her throat and the diamond bracelets on her wrists, and put
ear-rings in her ears, and the brooch upon her bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when her toilet was completed she looked, if looks
were all, a very royal bride, fit to share a young monarch’s
throne.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sat down again and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Matty, you may go and tell your master that I am
ready.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl left the room to take the message, but in the
hall she ran against some one who seemed on his way to
speak to the bride. And so she turned back to say.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Anna, here’s Jake asking if he can have a word
with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly. Tell the boy to come in,” said the young
lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>The son of the coachman, one of the younger grooms, entered,
hat in hand, bowing low.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, my boy, what is it?” inquired his mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, Miss, I telled her as she couldn’t, and she
said as she <i>must</i>, and I telled her as she shouldn’t, and she
said she <i>would</i>,” replied Jake, rather incoherently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Would?’ what?—who? I don’t understand you,
boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her, Miss. I telled her she couldn’t, nohow, but she
’lowed she <i>must</i>, anyhow. And I telled her she shouldn’t
then, there! and she ’lowed she <i>would</i>, so there!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“Would what, Jake?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“See you immediate, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Who</i> would see me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The young woman, which I think she is crazy, Miss,
and not safe to be seed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! dear me, Jake, what young woman are you
talking of?” said Miss Lyon, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her as runned in out’n the storm, Miss, and said how
she must see you; and I telled her she wasn’t fit to be
seed herself, being drippen’ wet, nor safe to be seed, being
sort o’ cracked, and—oh my laws! there she is now, a followed
of me!” exclaimed the boy, breaking off in dismay,
to stare with wide mouth and eyes at the opening door.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Lyon turned her head in that direction, and saw
standing there a slight, pale young creature, enveloped in a
long gray cloak, with its hood drawn over her head and
shading her face.</p>

      <div class='line'>They whispered—sin a shade had cast,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Upon her youthful frame,</div>
      <div class='line'>And scornful murmurs as she past</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Were mingled with her name.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She is not beautiful,” they said,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And the homeless wanderer through the wild winter-night,
she who had called herself Anna Lyon, stood in the
presence of the bride elect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla! Drusilla Sterling! Is it you? Is it really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>you! Oh, my poor child, how happy I am to see you!”
exclaimed Miss Lyon, in the utmost surprise and delight,
as she advanced with extended hands to welcome her unexpected
guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla suffered her cold fingers to be clasped, and she
raised her soft, appealing eyes to the young lady’s face;
but she spoke no word in reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my dear child, how sorrowful we have been for you!
Why did you leave your home? Where have you been?
What have you been doing? Where did you come from
last? And how came you out on such an awful night?
And oh, poor girl! in what a state you have come back?
Don’t try to answer any of my questions yet! You must
be warmed and fed first,” said Miss Lyon, who in her excitement
had hurried question upon question to the exhausted
girl, and seeing that she could not answer, repented
her own thoughtless vehemence, and turning to her servants,
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Marcy, take off her cloak and hang it up, and sit her
down in that arm-chair before the fire, and remove her wet
shoes. And, Jacob, go down stairs and ask Mrs. Dill to
send up a glass of hot port wine negus, and some warm, dry
toast. And be quick about it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jake hurried away to do his errand.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the young wanderer permitted the old nurse to
remove her cloak, and seat her in the chair before the fire,
and take off her wet boots.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marcy had not failed to see the fact that had also been
apparent to the old woman at the toll-gate. And as she
was passing out of the room with the wet cloak over her
arm, and the wet shoes in her hand, she stopped and whispered
to her young mistress:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lord pity her, poor thing, I’m right down sorry for
her; but she is not fit to be in your presence, Miss Anna.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For an instant the pure and high-born maiden recoiled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>with a look of pain and horror; but then quickly recovering
herself, she murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, no more of that. Take those damp things from
the room and hang them before one of the spare fires,
Marcy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And when the woman had gone, Miss Lyon walked up to
the poor wanderer and laid her hand tenderly on her
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little pale face turned itself around to hers. The
soft pleading eyes were raised:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Miss Lyon, that is well. Send all your women
from the room, for I must speak with you alone,” she murmured,
in a voice vibrating with suppressed anguish.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speak to me, then, my child; and speak freely. No
mother could listen to your story with more sympathy than
I shall,” said the heiress, drawing a chair to the fire and
sitting down near the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not yet married? the ceremony has not yet
been performed?” the wanderer inquired, looking wistfully
at the bride.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, certainly not, or I should not be here; we are
waiting for the minister. Did you want to see the
pageantry, my child? If so, you can do so,” said the
bride elect, smiling, as if to encourage her desponding
protegée.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>I</i> want to see it! No, Miss Lyon, I came here to-night
to put a stop to it,” exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To put a stop to it! Drusilla, are you mad, my dear?”
said Miss Lyon, in amazement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I was! I should have no duties to do then!
Oh, Miss Lyon!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Explain yourself, my dear Drusilla; for indeed I fear
some great grief has distracted your mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no; but oh, Miss Lyon, I am about to give you
great pain! as great almost as I suffer myself. Would I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>could suffer alone! Would I could suffer for both!”
moaned Drusilla, in a voice full of woe, as she bowed her
head upon her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speak out; speak freely,” said Miss Lyon, gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I alone were concerned, I could be silent. If it
were not to save one from crime and another from misery I
could be silent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay now, nay now, you do alarm me, Drusilla! To the
point, dear child! to the point!” urged Miss Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are thinking ill of me?” asked the girl, raising
those meek prayerful eyes to the face of the young lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Drusilla! No one can judge you with more leniency
than I shall, my poor, dear child. Do not fear to
open your heart to me,” said Miss Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no cause to fear on my own account, lady. You
said that you would judge me with leniency. You meant
that you would judge me with charity. But I am not a
subject of charity, Miss Lyon, I am a subject for justice,”
answered the girl, with gentle dignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am waiting to hear your communication, Drusilla,
whenever you please to tell it to me,” said Miss Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>But at that moment the door was opened, and Matilda
entered with a tray in her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, Miss, ole Marse say how the carriage
hasn’t come back long o’ the min’ser yet, and when he
comes he will send and let you know,” the maid announced.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, Matilda; what have you got covered up on
that tray?” inquired Miss Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please, I overtook Jake, awkward fellow, tumbling up
stairs with this in his hands, which he said he was ordered
to fetch it up for some one as was with you, and took it
away from him to fetch it myself, because if I hadn’t, he’d
have fallen down and broken all the glass and spilt all the
wine,” answered the girl, turning a wistful glance upon the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Quite right! Put the tray on that little table, and set
the table here by the fire, and leave the room,” said Miss
Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The maid obeyed orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>When she was gone Miss Lyon uncovered the tray, and
pressed the refreshments upon her visitor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla eagerly drank the warm wine and water, but
declined the dry toast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have so much thirst all the time, but I cannot swallow
a morsel of food, for it always chokes me!” she said, in explanation.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the girl had emptied the glass, she seemed somewhat
revived in strength, and Miss Lyon again suggested
that she should make the communication she promised.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a deep sigh, with her head bowed upon her bosom
and her hands clasped upon her knees, the girl began the
story of her short life and long sorrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>But perhaps we had better tell it for her, because, for one
reason, she suppressed much that would have vindicated
herself; since to have related it would have criminated
another. We will, with even-handed justice deal fairly by
both.</p>

<p class='c006'>The late Mrs. Chief Justice Lyon had been a notable
manager. She had looked well to her household, utterly
scorning the idea of entrusting her domestic affairs to the
hands of any hired housekeeper, until the infirmities of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>age came upon her, and she could no longer rise early and
sit up late, or go up and down stairs a dozen times a day,
as she had been accustomed to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she advertised for a housekeeper, who was required
to be the nonpareil of matrons and managers, and to furnish
the most unquestionable of references.</p>

<p class='c011'>She received, in reply, just thirty-three letters from applicants
for the place. Thirty-two were read, and cast into
the waste paper basket, without even the honor of an
answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>The thirty-third was read and considered.</p>

<p class='c011'>It came from a highly respectable woman, the widow of
a poor Baptist minister. Her age, her character, her competency
and her references were all unexceptionable—so
much so that old Mrs. Lyon seemed to think that the
Lord had created the Baptist minister’s widow for the
especial purpose of providing her with a housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there was a drawback.</p>

<p class='c011'>The widow, Mrs. Sterling, had an “encumbrance,” as a
child is cruelly called—a little girl, aged six years, from
whom she was unwilling to part. In mentioning this
“item,” Mrs. Sterling had said that, if allowed to bring
her child, she would consent to come at half the salary
offered by Mrs. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old lady pondered over the letter. She was very
anxious to have the housekeeper, but she did not want the
“encumbrance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally, as she could not come to any decision unaided, she
took up the letter and waddled off to the old judge’s “study,”
where he kept his law books and documents, and where he
read the newspapers, and smoked or dozed the greater part
of the day, but where he never “studied” for an hour.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sat down and read the letter to him, and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see she is just exactly the sort of woman that I
want—and a clergyman’s widow, too—so respectable. If I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>were to advertise, and keep on advertising for a year, I
might not meet with another so suitable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, engage her at once,” said the Chief Justice
with more promptness of decision than he had often brought
to bear upon his law cases.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but there’s a difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In what? Doesn’t she like the terms?—Give her her
own; you can afford it, if she suits you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She likes the terms well enough. Don’t you see she
offers to come at half what I give, if permitted to bring
her child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then where on earth is the difficulty? <i>I</i> don’t see it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, about the child, Judge.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, the little girl. Well, let the woman bring her
child; what possible objection can there be to that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but she would be an encumbrance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On whom, I would like to know? Not on you, not on
me, and certainly not on her mother. Nonsense, my dear,
let the child come; never make a difficulty about that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But children are so troublesome—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Especially when they are not our own. Tut, tut, if
you don’t want the woman, don’t take her; but if you do
want her, take her, and let her bring her little one. Bless
my soul alive, haven’t we got five or six dogs, and seven or
eight cats, and half a score of birds? and if one child can
make a hundredth part of the noise that they do, I’m
greatly mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but children are not like them; children are
always eating cake, or sucking toffy, and toddling about
with nasty, sticky hands, laying hold of your skirts—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear, don’t say mine; I don’t wear any. Nonsense,
Sukey, take the woman and risk the child. Or stay—I see
light at last. Take her on trial with the child, and then,
if it should prove a nuisance, get rid of it, or of both.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s just what I <i>can</i> do. Thank you, Judge, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>were always a wise counsellor,” said Mrs. Lyon, turning to
leave the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t know. But hark ye, Sukey, my dear. No cutting
down of the poor woman’s salary on account of her
‘encumbrance.’ That is a reason for raising it, not for reducing
it,” called the judge after his retreating wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I never intended to give her less than full pay,”
replied Mrs. Lyon, as she went to her room to answer her
letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The result was the engagement of Mrs. Sterling, with
her “encumbrance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The widow and her child arrived one cold day in
December, soon after the family were settled in their town
house for the winter. She was the least in the world like
the “poor widow” of poetry and fiction.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was a little, wiry, muscular looking body, with no
encumbrance of flesh, whatever she might have of family,
for she was rather thin in form and face. She had a high
color, black hair and black eyes. She was cheerful, active
and enterprising. She wore no widow’s weeds, because, she
explained, it had been three years since she had lost her
husband, and black was a bore, always catching dirt and
showing all it caught, and making everybody gloomy. She
wore serviceable browns and grays, or dark crimsons.</p>

<p class='c011'>She entered upon her duties with great energy, and soon
had the house in perfect order, and the domestic machinery
moving like magic. It is needless to say that she gave
great satisfaction to her employers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know how I ever got along without her. I
know I could not now,” said Mrs. Lyon, adding, “I
would rather have her, even with two children instead of
one, than any body else without any. And indeed the
child is <i>not</i> a nuisance, after all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>No, the child was not a nuisance. And neither did she
bear the slightest resemblance to her mother. She was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>delicate little creature, with a pure, pale face; large, soft,
gray eyes, and bright, silky, brown hair. She was very
quiet, thoughtful and industrious for such a mere infant.
Her mother ruled her with the same rigid discipline with
which she governed all the servants of the household committed
to her charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little one was never allowed to go out of doors except
on Sunday, when she was taken by her mother to
church, or sent by herself to Sunday school. On all other
days she was confined strictly to the housekeeper’s room,
where, after learning one lesson, doing one sum, and writing
one copy, she was kept stitching patch-work quilts from
morning till night.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Chief Justice, who was an awful myth to the little
girl, had never once set eyes on her.</p>

<p class='c011'>But old Mrs. Lyon, coming occasionally to the housekeeper’s
room to give some orders, would see the demure
little creature sitting on her low stool in the corner of the
hearth, and stitching soberly at her patch-work, and she
would say to the mother:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Sterling, why don’t you let that child run out into
the garden and play in this fine, clear, frosty weather?
The air would do her good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I don’t know, madam. You see how delicate she
is; she might take cold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Delicate, and no wonder, Mrs. Sterling; kept mewed
up in this close room at needle-work all the time, as if she
was sewing for her living—a babe of six years old! If you
are afraid to let her go into the garden, let her run about
the house; don’t keep her here always.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, madam; but I cannot let her do so. She
might grow troublesome; and, besides, she <i>will</i> have to
sew for a living some day or other if she doesn’t do it now.
She can’t have me always to look to; she will have to take
care of herself, and so she must learn to be patient and
industrious by times.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Poor little thing,” murmured the old lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t pity her, if you please, madam, or put into her
head that she is ill-used, for she isn’t. I do everything for
her good, and it’s not likely that I would do any thing else,
for I am her own mother,” said the housekeeper, respectfully
but firmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t believe you know what is for her good, and if
you are her own mother you treat her worse than any stepmother
would,” the old lady thought and would have said,
only that she was a little afraid of Mrs. Sterling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She isn’t the least like you. Who is she like?” inquired
Miss Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her father. See, here is his miniature,” said the
widow, drawing from her pocket a morocco case, and handing
it to the old lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, she is like her father. What a very interesting
face he has. Has he been dead long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Three years last March; he died of consumption. I
suppose she will go the same way,” said the widow, indicating
her child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You should not let her hear you say so; if she gets the
impression that she is to die of consumption because her
father did she will probably do so,” whispered Mrs. Lyon.
Then aloud she spoke this truth: “Nobody need die of
consumption or of anything else except old age, unless they
have a mind to. Plenty of good food and proper clothing,
and out-door exercise will prevent consumption.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And with a parting glance of pity at the pale child, the
old lady left the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mustn’t mind what Mrs. Lyon says; she is not
like us. She is a great lady, and thinks of nothing but
taking her ease and indulging herself, and she fancies that
<i>we</i> can do the same; but you know we can’t,” said the
widow, applying the antidote to what she considered the
poison that had been dropped into the child’s mind. “We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>must deny ourselves, and bear our burden, and after all it
is easy enough to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said the mite in the corner, repeating her Sunday
school Scripture text, for our Saviour said, ‘Whosoever will
come after me let him deny himself, take up his cross and
follow me.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and if you don’t do it you know you will be eternally
lost,” said the clergyman’s widow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but our Saviour will never let me be lost, no never;
I know that much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you know that? If you disobey him you will
be lost.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no! He will not let me be—no, never, not even if
I was to steal away from my work and go and play in the
garden. He would forgive me like he did Peter; and then
I should feel sorry, and cry, and then he would make it all
right again,” said the quaint little infant Theologian with
an air of positive conviction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Child! where did you learn such bad doctrines? Not
at Sunday school, I know,” said the widow, in dismay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I did, in the Sunday school, in the Bible texts,
and they are good. Our Saviour was good and all that he
did was good. Don’t he say that he was sent to seek and
to save them that were <i>lost</i>? And I know he will never
let me be lost, no nor the old lady neither, even if she does
take her ease, because she is so good-hearted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss! don’t you know it is wrong to contradict your
mother? And you have contradicted me several times.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know—but—I must say what is true about Our
Saviour when we talk of him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you shall sew one hour longer this evening, as a
punishment for your disrespect to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, mamma, I will sew all day and all night, if that
will do you any good, so you will let me say what is true
about Our Saviour. Sewing is easy enough, the dear knows—easier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>than being scourged and stoned, and all that, like
some of his poor friends were for his sake,” said the child,
as she carefully fitted the little squares of her patch-work
together.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only six years old and to talk like that! She is one
of the children who are doomed to die early,” thought Mrs.
Sterling.</p>

<p class='c011'>And indeed any one looking at that child, with her delicate
frame, large brain and active intellect, must have come
to the same conclusion. But they would every one have
been mistaken. There was a wonderful vitality and power
of endurance in that little slight nervous frame. No one
is faultless. And if this little atom had a fault, it was that
of being just a “wee bit” self-opinionated. She was a very
promising pupil in a very orthodox Sunday school; yet
from the very texts they had taught her she had received
impressions that the teachers certainly never had intended
to give her, and these impressions had become convictions
in defence of which she was willing at six years to suffer
the baby martyrdom of—“sewing all day and all night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the Christmas Holidays were approaching,
and the young son of the house was coming home to spend
them. And his uncle and cousin were invited to meet him.
Great preparations were made to entertain the party. Old
Mrs. Lyon’s visits to the housekeeper’s room became more
and more frequent as the time for the arrival of the visitors
drew near.</p>

<p class='c011'>And whenever the old lady came, she inevitably found
the quiet child sitting on her stool in the corner of the
hearth sewing for dear life.</p>

<p class='c011'>But old Mrs. Lyon took no farther notice of the infant.
Partly because she was too full of her own affairs and partly
because she was displeased by the housekeeper’s disregard of
her advice.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the demure child, listening to every word that passed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>with the interest only a recluse could feel, heard a great
deal about “Mr. Alexander.” Whoever else might be
coming, it was for this darling only son that his mother
planned. It was of his comfort and pleasure only that she
thought and talked.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the little listening child grew to look upon “Mr.
Alexander” as some young king of Israel—some splendid
and magnificent Saul, or Solomon, who was to be the glory
of the house. And because hero-worshipping was a necessity
of her deep, earnest, reverent soul, she began to worship
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, two or three days before Christmas, the
expected visitors began to arrive.</p>

<p class='c011'>First came General Lyon, the fine, martial-looking old
man with his commanding form and snow white hair and
beard; and his grand-daughter, the beautiful Anna Lyon,
then a fair, blooming, blue-eyed and golden-haired hoyden
of twelve years of age; both attended by their servants.
And next came Mr. Alexander, then a rollicking young
man of eighteen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole party was assembled in the drawing-room,
and Mrs. Sterling happened to be with them when Mr. Alexander
was announced and entered, in a great noisy bustle
of joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>He shook hands heartily with his father and then with
his uncle; and he embraced his mother and his cousin, and
then, before he knew what he was about, he threw his arms
around the housekeeper and hugged and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, see here! you know I didn’t mean it, I didn’t indeed,
ma’am; I beg ten thousand pardons! but I am so
much in the habit of kissing everybody I meet here that—that—I
kissed you by mistake. But if you don’t mind it, <i>I</i>
don’t; or if you feel aggrieved, why, you may kiss and hug
<i>me</i>, and that will make it all square between us,” laughed
the boy, when he discovered his error.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>The clergyman’s widow curtsied very stiffly without moving
a muscle of her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is Mrs. Sterling, who manages our house, Alick,”
said his mother, gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Sterling, I am very happy to have the honor of
knowing you, and I am persuaded that the house is managed
to perfection,” said the young man, bowing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The widow curtsied more stiffly than before, and then
withdrew from the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I say, Anna, I wouldn’t kiss her again for the best
hunter in your father’s stables; my lips got frost-bitten by
that first encounter,” whispered the young man, with a
smile, to his cousin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Served you right, Alick. You should look before you
leap,” laughed Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That mightn’t always prevent my leaping, especially if
the feat seemed a dangerous one, though it would have done
so in this case, I admit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were interrupted by the arrival of another guest—an
uninvited and unexpected, if not an unwelcome one.</p>

<p class='c011'>The door was opened by a servant, who grimly announced:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Richard Hammond.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And “Poor Dick,” the black sheep of the flock, entered
the room, looking rather sheepish, it must be confessed.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet he was a very handsome and gentlemanly youth,
tall, slender, with a fine Grecian profile, with a clear brown
complexion, black curling hair and dark changing eyes—with
a frank countenance and an engaging smile that few,
or none, could resist.</p>

<p class='c011'>But well he might look sheepish, poor outlawed fellow,
for his entrance cast an instantaneous chill over the family
circle.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon drew himself up haughtily. The chief
justice looked grave, his wife sad, and their son angry.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Only Anna seemed pleased. And not only pleased, but
delighted. For the instant she saw him she bounced up,
overturning two or three chairs in her hurry and rushed to
meet him, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cousin Dick! Oh, dear Cousin Dick, I am so glad
you’ve come! It would have been such a dull Christmas,
indeed no Christmas at all, without you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she gave him both her hands and pressed and shook
his, and drew him towards the group, and first instinctively
presented him to the kind-hearted old lady:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aunt Lyon, here is Cousin Dick. Are you not very
glad to see him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you do, Richard?” said the old lady, offering
her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the black sheep stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle, here’s Dick. Isn’t it a pleasant surprise?”
asked Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>And uncle had to come and shake the scape-grace by the
hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Grandpa, look here; you don’t see Dick. Here’s Dick
waiting to speak to you!” she persisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>And General Lyon had to turn and meet the engaging
smile of the handsome boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick,” said Anna, in a low whisper, giving her
betrothed a sharp dig in the ribs with her elbow, and a
very vicious look from her angry blue eyes, “if you don’t
stop glowering, and come and speak to Dick, I’ll never
speak to <i>you</i> again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anything to keep peace in the family,” laughed Mr.
Alexander, as he cleared up his brow, and went and
welcomed the new comer.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in two minutes more Dick was seated in the circle
around the fire, the life of the little company talking and
laughing, telling jokes and singing songs, and keeping
everybody pleased and amused, so that they forgot they did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>not want him, and almost fancied that they could not do
without him.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was nothing very wrong about Dick Hammond.
It is true that he was a very unpromising law student,
being rather idle and extravagant—fonder of play than of
work, and loving his “friends” better than himself. You
know the sort of man—one of that sort of whom it is
always said that he is “nobody’s enemy but his own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick had a neat little patrimony, but his relations said
that he was in a fair way of making “ducks and drakes”
of it, and they discountenanced and disapproved of him
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>His one fast friend was his cousin Anna, and every year
she was growing to be a stronger and more important one.</p>

<p class='c011'>At ten o’clock that night, Mr. Richard Hammond made
a motion to go, but the chief justice said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stay all night, Dick.” And old Mrs. Lyon added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stay and spend the Christmas holidays with us, Dick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Mr. Richard stayed, and sent for his portmanteau from
the hotel where he had stopped on his first coming to the
city.</p>

<p class='c011'>And having the freedom of the house, he took more liberties
in it than any one else would dare to do—going into
any part of it, and at any hour he pleased; popping in and
out of the chief justice’s secluded study, and breaking up
his naps; popping in and out of the old lady’s sacred
dressing-room, and startling her in the midst of the mysterious
rites of the toilet; and bouncing in and out of the
housekeeper’s room, the pantry or the kitchen, to the serious
discomfiture of the manager, the butler and the cook.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet everybody loved Dick, so long as the influence of his
frank manners, sunny smile, and sweet voice was upon
them. But when that was withdrawn, and they were left
to their sober reason, they strongly disapproved of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little pitchers have long ears and wide mouths,” says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the proverb. And the little pitcher in Mrs. Sterling’s private
apartment was no exception to the general rule. Sitting
stitching at her patch-work, she often heard Mr. Richard’s
shortcomings discussed, and she pitied him, for she
thought that he had wandered away very far from the fold,
and was in a very bad way indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day when poor Dick popped into the housekeeper’s
room, to ask for some brandy and salt to dip the wick of his
candles in, to make “corpse lights” for ghosts to carry, and
scare the maids with, he found no one there but the child,
sitting in the corner and stitching patch-work as usual.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked up at him solemnly, and nearly annihilated
him with the following appalling question:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Young man, are you one of the lost sheep of the House
of Israel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Eh?</span>” exclaimed Dick, starting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ask you, are you a lost sheep? They say you are a
black sheep, and I believe it is the black sheep that go
astray,” she said, gravely, and folding her hands and contemplating
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick burst out laughing, but when he recovered himself
he answered very gravely:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, I fear I am a lost sheep, little girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, that is bad, but don’t be frightened. Our Saviour
knows where you are, and He will be sure to find you, and
fetch you into the fold. Because, you know, He came to
seek and to save those that are lost. And what he came to
do He <i>will</i> do, and nothing in this world can prevent him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll be shot if that isn’t an encouraging doctrine if it is
a true one, little girl. I sometimes wish somebody <i>would</i>
find me and fetch me into a place of safety; but I fear I
shouldn’t be worth keeping when found, for I am a sad, foolish,
naughty sheep, child,” said the young man, with a self-mocking
laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind, don’t make game of yourself. If our Saviour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>thinks you worth looking for you are too good to be
laughed at; and when He does find you and fetch you into
the fold, He will make as good a sheep of you as—as—as—”
The child seemed at a loss for a comparison, until her face
suddenly lighted up, and she said: “As Mr. Alexander
himself!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As Mr. Alexander himself! Oh, my eye! catch me,
somebody! Only there’s nobody to do it!” said Dick,
rolling up against the wall and holding his sides.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the matter? Have you got the stomach-ache?
There’s some rum and molasses in the cupboard,” said the
child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, oh no!” cried Dick, bursting into vociferous laughter.
“You are the solemnest little quiz! To hold up Mr.
Alexander as a model for me! Well! I’m bad enough,
goodness knows, but—! Why, little one, Mr. Alexander
isn’t a sheep at all, either good or bad! He’s a goat, a rank
black goat, and never has been in the fold, and never would
be let into it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, it is very wrong in you to speak ill of a gentleman
so in his absence,” gravely asserted the little monitor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So it is; you are right there, little girl,” admitted the
scape-grace.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the timely entrance of Mrs. Sterling put an end to
this strange interview, and possibly saved the young man a
serious lecture from the little child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick got his candles, brandy and salt, and whatever else
he wanted of the housekeeper; for that strong-minded
woman, no more than her weaker sisters and brethren,
could resist Dick’s irresistible smile.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>That night “a most horrid spectre,” wrapped in a long
winding sheet, and bearing a corpse candle that cast a
cadaverous color over his countenance, stalked through the
lower regions of the house, frightening the maids, and the
men too, for that matter, from their propriety, and raising
such a row in the dignified residence of the chief justice as
might have brought the police down upon any house of a
less assured standing.</p>

<p class='c011'>And upon an investigation of the matter next morning,
Mr. Richard was discovered to be at the bottom of the
business.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the quiet little girl in the housekeeper’s room heard
again of his delinquencies and pitied him and wished that
he was more like Mr. Alexander, that splendid paragon of
youth whom his mother was always praising. The child,
closely confined to her mother’s chamber, had never seen
the hero of her admiration. But the hour was near at
hand when she was to meet him in an interview destined
to determine the whole course of her future life.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was on Christmas Eve. All the preparations for the
Christmas festival were made. The turkeys were already
killed and dressed for the roaster; the hams were in soak;
the plum pudding was mixed; the pies and cakes baked;
and all the materials for the egg-nogg and apple-toddy laid
out on the pantry table; and the notable housekeeper
might have taken her ease but for one thing.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was to be a pantomime at the city theatres that
evening. And the three young people were to go. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>as there were no reserved seats, they were to go very early
in order to secure good places, for it was foreseen that the
house would be very much crowded. And thus dinner was
ordered two hours earlier than usual, so that they might
get off in time.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Sterling, having finished her morning’s work, was
putting off her working gown of brown alpacca to put on a
nice dress of black silk in honor of Christmas Eve, when
old Mrs. Lyon came in to give the instructions about the
dinner, and having given them, immediately left the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>The housekeeper was in no plight to go all the way down
to the kitchen, so she sent the child to tell the cook to come
up to her for orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little one went and delivered her message faithfully;
and was returning to her mother’s room, when, in passing
through the back hall, she suddenly met the god of her infant
idolatry face to face. She knew him at once, either by
instinct or because there was no other young man beside
Mr. Richard (whom she knew by sight) in the house. She
backed up into a corner to let him pass.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heyday! Who have we here? A child in the house?
I haven’t seen such a thing here for years! Or are you a
fairy changling?” inquired Mr. Alexander, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>The child did not reply, but—I am sorry to say—put her
finger in her mouth, dropped her chin and rolled up her
eyes in a shy glance at the splendid youth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah bah! that’s very nasty! Don’t stick your finger
in your mouth and stare, but hold up your head and answer
when you are spoken to. Tell me who you are, little girl!”
said Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>Prince Solomon had condescended to issue orders and
they were immediately obeyed by his loyal subject. Down
went the little finger; up went the little face, and she
answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am Mrs. Sterling’s little girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“And a very nice little girl, too, to do as you are bid.
Always do so, do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so you are the housekeeper’s daughter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is it that I haven’t seen anything of you before?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because mother never lets me go out of her room.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never lets you go out of her room?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because she is afraid that the——” Here the child
lowered her voice to a tone of mysterious awe—“<i>chief
justice</i> would be angry if he saw me about.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bosh about his being angry! He is not a King
Herod to hate the sight of a child, or desire the death of
the innocents. You don’t mean to tell me that you are
cooped up in the housekeeper’s room all the time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh no, sir, I am not cooped up anywhere any of the
time; only the poultry for Christmas was cooped up, and
that was in the back yard; I saw them through the
window. But I sit on a nice little stool in mother’s room
and sew pretty quilt pieces.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All day long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And every day?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, sir, not every day. I go to Sunday school on
Sundays.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But on all other days you are kept confined to that
room all day long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you look just as if you were, you poor little pale
thing, and that is the truth. It is horrid. I’ll speak to
my mother about it. Why, you ought to be romping all
over the house, you know, and going to pantomimes o’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Christmas, like other children. Say, little a—a—What is
your name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna Drusilla Sterling, sir,” said the child, beginning
to grow restive under all this questioning, and to swing
her shoulders from side to side, after the manner of some
children when saying their lessons.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There—don’t do that; it’s ugly,” said Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the swinging instantly ceased.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Anna Drusilla Sterling?’ Well, I have one Anna
already, so I shall call you Drusilla,” said the young man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But my mother calls me Anny.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind what your mother calls you—I shall call
you Drusilla. Well, little Drusilla, wouldn’t you like to go
to the pantomime with us to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know, sir. Please, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is something got up to amuse little children like
you, though big children like myself find it equally diverting.
Wouldn’t you like to go? I should like to take
you, and to see it through your great staring eyes, as well
as through my own. It would be a ‘new sensation.’
Come, what do you say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, sir. Is it pretty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And good!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is heavenly!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I think I should like to go, sir, if mother will let
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, she will let you fast enough, for I shall make a
point of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did you call it, sir, please?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A pantomime.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I know now,” said the child, with a sudden look of
bright intelligence; “it is something about Moses and the
children of Israel, isn’t it, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh? ‘Moses and the children of Israel?’ What put
that into your little noddle?” laughed the young man.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“Why, sir, you know the books of Moses are called the
panta—panta—something; it’s a very hard word, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you are talking of the pentateuch?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir, a very hard word. I always miss it at the
class, it is so very hard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very,” laughed the young man.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now, as the voice of the housekeeper was heard calling
her child, the little girl made her Sunday school curtsey,
and ran away from her new friend to join her mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alexander gazed after her as he might if she had
been sixteen instead of six, for he was fond of children, as
well as of kittens and puppies, and all small creatures.
They amused him. He was now determined that this
quaint little child should go to the pantomime with himself
and his friends, for he knew perfectly well that to watch
<i>her</i>, and witness <i>her</i> wonder and delight, would be as
diverting as to see the play itself—it would, in that way
double his own entertainment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alick was benevolent, but not very scrupulous, I
regret to confess. So, when he went to the housekeeper’s
room to ask leave to take the child to the pantomime, judging
that the Baptist preacher’s widow would set her face
against all such exhibitions, he took a hint from the child’s
mistake, and was so unprincipled as to persuade that pious
matron that the spectacle in question was a historical affair,
illustrative of the Israelites, and very instructive and edifying
to the youthful mind. And so, with Mr. Richard to
back him he talked the housekeeper into consenting that
her child should accompany them, especially as Miss Anna
was to be one of the party. And Mrs. Sterling began to
dress little Drusilla—we shall call the child by her second
name, for the same reason that Mr. Alexander did, to distinguish
her from the other Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately after dinner the young party set out, and
reached the theatre in time to get good front seats.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>The pantomime was “Jack the Giant Killer.” But as
Mr. Alexander kept little Drusilla beside himself, and kept
the play bill in his own hands, he found it easy to persuade
the simple child that the exhibition was of “David and
Goliath,” Jack was David, and Jack’s first giant was Goliath.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the child was exceedingly edified, as well as highly
entertained.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alexander found it “as good as a play,” and much
better than a pantomime, to watch her. Her credulity was
equal to her delight, and both were unbounded. But she
thought it was not exactly like the Scripture story, after
all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alexander explained to her that they could not make
it exactly like, because things were so different now to what
they were then.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Drusilla accepted the explanation in full faith, saying
in her solemn way, that she supposed they did the best
they could, and that we must “take the will for the deed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The pantomime was over a little after ten o’clock, and
the youthful party returned home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Drusilla, restored to her mother’s charge, would
have rehearsed for her benefit all the great spectacle of
“David and Goliath,” but that the good lady told her that
it was time for her to be asleep, and made her go immediately
to bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding the late hour at which the young people
had retired on Christmas Eve, they were all up by times on
Christmas day. All was lively bustle throughout the
house. Everybody had Christmas gifts, at which each pretended
to be as much surprised as he or she was expected
to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Anna had a little set of diamonds, consisting of
ear-rings and brooch, presented by her grandfather; an
ermine tippet and muff from her uncle; a set of antique
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>lace from her aunt; a diamond bracelet from her betrothed;
and from scape-grace Dick a real King Charles lap-dog,
which she openly preferred to all her other presents, because
she said it was alive, and could give love for love.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old lady had a new patent easy chair, a new pair of
gold spectacles, and a set of sables.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the gentlemen of the party were overwhelmed with
embroidered slippers, smoking-caps, dressing-gowns, penwipers,
and so forth.</p>

<p class='c011'>The housekeeper was presented with a new brown silk
dress. And there was not a servant in the house but
received a present.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And who has got anything for little Drusilla?”
inquired Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>But nobody answered him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’m dashed! Only one bit of a baby in the
house, and nobody has thought of her. And this especially
a child’s festival, because it celebrates the birth of the
Divine Child, who also loved little children! Say, mother,
the shops are open in the city this morning, are they not?”
inquired Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Until ten o’clock, Alick; not after,” replied the old
lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, it is only eight now—plenty of time. I’m
off; but I’ll be back to breakfast,” said Mr. Alexander,
darting out of the drawing-room, seizing his hat in the hall,
and rushing from the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, what a kind heart has this child of our old age,
John!” said the old lady, turning proudly and fondly to
her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes—yes; a good boy—a good boy,” answered the
Chief Justice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Anna, my dear, you will be a happy woman if you
live long enough, for you will have a good husband,” she
continued, turning to her intended daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Anna shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t seem to agree with me, Anna.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes I do, Aunt Lyon, to some extent. I think
Alick is really very kind when it amuses him; but I don’t
think he would be kind to any living creature when it
would bore him to be so. For instance, he would bring me
home a present, and be really delighted with my delight in
it; but he wouldn’t give up a skating party to take me to
a wax-work show if I were to cry myself ill from disappointment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I suppose you have had a tiff with him; that’s of
no consequence at all. ‘The quarrel of lovers is the renewal
of love,’” said the old lady, laughing to herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Anna had had no tiff with her betrothed, and her
judgment of him was a righteous one.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alick soon came rushing in with his arms full of
packages, and looking like a railway porter. He set down
three large ones on the floor, threw himself into a chair,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now then, mother, send for little Drusilla. It will be
fun to watch her eyes when she sees these things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Lyon rang the bell, and sent a servant to fetch the
little girl to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>The child’s mother being in a particularly good humor
since receiving the new brown silk dress, made no objection,
but sent her along in charge of the servant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Drusilla entered the drawing-room, looking very
pretty in her new red merino frock, which suited well with
her dark hair and dark eyes, and clear, pale face.</p>

<p class='c011'>She made her little curtsy at the door, and then as Mr.
Alexander held out his arms she ran straight up to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, then,” said the young gentleman, taking her on
his knee, while the mysterious packages lay all around his
feet, “if you could have your wish, what would you wish
for?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“Mother says it is foolish and wicked to wish for anything,
because if it is for our good, the Lord will give it to
us whether or not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well but suppose you were so foolish and wicked as to
wish for anything, what would it be?” persisted the young
man, while all the other members of the Christmas party
looked on, smilingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The child pondered gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come—what would it be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think a work-box,” answered the child, looking up at
length.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What! not a doll-baby?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I would rather have a doll-baby, but I thought
it would be <i>too</i> wicked to wish for that, because it is useless,”
said the little one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, look here, now! First, here’s the doll-baby,”
said Mr. Alick, unwrapping one of the parcels, and taking
from a mass of tissue paper a splendid wax doll, with rosy
cheeks, blue eyes and golden hair, all dressed in blue
satin and white lace.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh-h-h! m-y-y!” exclaimed the child, in breathless
delight, as she took the doll and held it up before her, and
gazed at it with ever-widening eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alexander laughed and squeezed her, he so much
enjoyed her enjoyment, and the whole party looked on,
amused and interested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t it a beauty?” asked the youth, giving the child
another squeeze.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a love! it is a darling! it is as pretty as—as—as
Miss Anna!” she exclaimed, turning her eyes from the
golden-haired doll to the golden-haired girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, little one! That compliment is sincere,
however flattering,” laughed the heiress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now look here!” said Mr. Alexander, taking up
another parcel; “she is wearing her ball dress, you know,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>which is very proper for Christmas, but would never do for
every day. And a thrifty little woman like you would
never let her doll wear her best clothes for common; so you
must fit her out with a wardrobe, and here are the goods to
do it with.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he unrolled a second parcel, and displayed a yard
each of pink, blue and buff cambric, and several yards of
white muslin, and some remnants of ribbon and lace.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now,” he said, as the child was contemplating
these additional treasures with increased delight, “now you
will require something to make them up with, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no; I mustn’t wish for anything more. This is
too much!” said the little one, with eyes dancing for joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Except what you wished for first of all, which I think
was something like this,” said Mr. Alexander opening a
third parcel, and producing a pretty little work-box fitted
out with scissors, thimble, needles, thread, and every
requisite for sewing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how much I do thank you, sir. Once before I
dreamt I had pretty things like these all to myself, and I
was sorry I ever woke up. Do you think I’ll wake up this
time, sir?” inquired the little girl, evidently perplexed
between delight and dismay.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alexander laughed, and intensely enjoyed the pastime
that he had purchased at so small an outlay, but the
old lady said, very gravely:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have bewildered the child, Alick. She is not used
to presents, and you should have treated her upon the
same principle as that upon which the doctors treat their
patients, who have been suffering from a long starvation,
and given her but a little at a time. And now put her off
your knee and come to breakfast; or if you can’t part with
her, bring her along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alexander immediately put the little creature down,
and told her to take up her treasures and run away with
them to her mother as fast as she could.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Mr. Alexander could give the child presents and divert
himself with her delight in them, but he could not consent
to be bothered with her at the breakfast table, where he
wished to give “his whole mind” to the business there to
be on hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>His mother, more considerate, touched the bell, and told
the servant who answered it to help the child to carry her
presents to the housekeeper’s room.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man gathered the parcels up and took Drusilla by
the hand; but as he led her from the room she suddenly
looked back, impulsively broke away from her guard, and
ran up to her benefactor and took his hand and kissed it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what a grateful little imp you are, to be sure!
It is worth while trying to please <i>you</i>; one succeeds so well
and one’s efforts are appreciated and thanked,” said the
young man, raising the child in his arms and kissing her,
and then darting a half-merry, half-reproachful glance at
his cousin Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you meant that for <i>me</i>, Mr. Alick, I don’t see the
point of it. You never do anything to please <i>me</i>, unless it
still better pleases yourself. You are one of the sort of
folk who would carelessly fling a dollar to a strange beggar,
but would not lose an hour’s rest by the bedside of a sick
friend,” said plain-spoken Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, there’s somebody that will do both,” said Mr.
Alexander, jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the
direction of Dick. “He sat up with old Jerry Brown, who
had the smallpox. I wonder if you would have liked him
so well, Anna, if he had taken it; as he might have done;
and lost his hair and eyebrows and been otherwise badly
marked?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes I would, Alick! But, thank goodness, Dick, darling,
you didn’t get it, and you are not marked; but just as
good-looking as ever,” said Anna, defiantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, come, this is pretty quarrelling among cousins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>on Christmas morning, too! Put a stop to it,” said Mrs.
Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young people laughed and obeyed. They were only
“sparring.” And they all sat down to the breakfast table
in high, good humor.</p>

<p class='c011'>And little Drusilla went back to her mother, as happy as
it was possible for a child to be. And her happiness was
all associated with the idea of Mr. Alexander, that splendid
being who had been the central object of all her wonder,
curiosity and admiration, long before she had set eyes on
him. She had never dreamed of such bliss as she now
enjoyed, and all through him!</p>

<p class='c011'>Up to this time her little life had been dreary enough,
more dreary than even she knew since she had known
nothing better with which to compare it. Her very earliest
recollections were of her father’s sick room, and his long
and painful illness; and then came his death, and her
mother’s sorrow and their poverty; and finally, this situation
in the family of the Chief Justice, where the child
had been led to believe that her presence could be only tolerated
for the sake of her mother’s valuable services, and
upon condition of herself being kept out of the sight and
hearing of the family.</p>

<p class='c011'>All these were very miserable and gloomy antecedents;
but now they had passed away like the shadows of the
night; for now came this bright, young Mr. Alexander, to
bring daylight and sunshine into her infant life.</p>

<p class='c011'>His kindness to the pale orphan did not cease with
Christmas Day. So long as the Christmas and New-Year’s
holidays lasted, Mr. Alick insisted on little Drusilla sharing
all the young people’s amusements; because, in point of
fact, it greatly enhanced his enjoyment to have her with
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the holidays were over, General Lyon took his
grand-daughter back to school; Mr. Alexander returned to
college; and the house was emptied of its visitors.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>In taking leave of his pet, Mr. Alick had said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, Drusilla, when I am gone you must be my
mother’s little girl, do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how I wish I might! Oh, how I <i>do</i> wish I
might!” said the child, weeping and clinging to her
friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother, when I am gone, you’ll be good to the poor
little thing, if only for my sake, won’t you?” he inquired,
as a feeling of real pity moved his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed I will, Alick,” earnestly replied the old lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you will not let old Bishop Sterling keep her
mewed up in that horrid room all the time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not if I can prevent it, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With this promise Mr. Alick departed.</p>

<p class='c011'>And little Drusilla clung to the old lady’s skirts, and
wept as if her heart would break.</p>

<p class='c011'>For her the day had departed with the sun that had
made its light, and the darkness of the night had come
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>You may depend upon it that the old lady sincerely sympathized
with the child who wept for <i>her</i> son’s departure,
and so she petted little Drusilla, and took her out that day,
when she went in the carriage to purchase some articles
that were needed in the housekeeping.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The little girl grew to be a great favorite with the old
lady; first, for her beloved and only son’s sake.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Poor Alick was so fond of the child,” she said; though
why she called the gay and prosperous young collegian
“poor,” only aged mothers can tell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Afterwards she loved the little one for its own sake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The child is such a quiet little creature,” she said, “and
so intelligent and obliging.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Drusilla had the freedom of the house. When her
tasks were over in the housekeeper’s room she might wander
where she would, and was tolerated like a pet kitten.</p>

<p class='c011'>She would creep into the old lady’s sitting-room, and nestle
down at her feet, ready to hold a skein of silk for her to
wind; to pick up her scissors when she should drop them;
to ring the bell for a servant, or to do anything else that
her little hands and willing mind could accomplish.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so it came to pass that she became useful and even
necessary to her benefactress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have no idea how many steps about my room the
little creature saves me,” said Mrs. Lyon to the child’s
mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very glad to hear it, madam; it is her duty to
make herself useful,” replied the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then she is so much company.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope she knows her place, madam, and is not pert.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is a little dear, and I would not be without her for
anything; so don’t be troubled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I trust in you, madam, to send her away whenever she
becomes annoying to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite right; when she becomes annoying I shall do so,”
laughed the old lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whenever Mrs. Lyon got letters from Mr. Alexander she
read them to little Drusilla; and in no one could she have
found a more attentive, intelligent and sympathizing listener.
In almost every letter the young gentleman wrote:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give my love to my little pet, and kiss her for me,” or
words to that effect.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Whenever Mrs. Lyon wrote to Mr. Alexander she would
smilingly ask the child what message she had to send; and
little Drusilla would answer:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please say I sent him a love and a kiss; and I ask our
Father to bless him whenever I say my prayers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the message would be faithfully transmitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes when Mrs. Lyon chanced to be out of her
room the little girl would creep to the door of Judge Lyon’s
study, and peep shyly in.</p>

<p class='c011'>And whether the old lady happened to be there or not
the old gentleman would call the child in, and pat her
head, and talk to her, and feel in all his pockets for stray
pennies to give her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Drusilla had but one use for pennies—“to drop in
the purse” that was carried around on Sundays in the
Sunday school.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Sterling, seeing how really welcome her child was,
“in hall and bower,” no longer tried to keep her confined
to the housekeeper’s room.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the winter passed away, and the spring opened.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early in the season the family, with their whole establishment
of servants, migrated to Crowood, the fine old
country-seat of the chief justice, situated in the dense
forest-land of the valley. Of course Mrs. Sterling and her
child went along with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among woods, fields, and streams, birds, shrubs and
flowers, little Drusilla seemed in her native element, and
with her fellow-creatures. Her enjoyment of nature was
intense and her delight unbounded. Her joy overflowed
and communicated itself to every one in the family. Even
the old justice said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The child makes me long to have my grandchildren
about my knees; for, after all, this little one isn’t ours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if she isn’t she’s a pet of poor Alick’s, and that
makes <i>me</i> think a deal of her,” answered Mrs. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>The old lady was a great flora-culturist, and had one of
the most beautiful flower-gardens in the country. It was
her pleasure to tend it herself; and she passed much of her
time in dibbling and digging, weeding and watering, planting
and transplanting her favorite specimens.</p>

<p class='c011'>And on these occasions the child was always at her heels,
with little spade, rake, hoe, watering-pot, or guano basket;
and she soon learned to know the name, and watch the
growth of every variety of flower as well and as carefully
as her benefactress could.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Lyon was also a poultry fancier, and had some of
the finest broods in the neighborhood. Moreover, she chose
to look after her hen-roosts and nests in person.</p>

<p class='c011'>And whenever she visited her poultry yard for this purpose
little Drusilla would walk behind her with a basket,
which she would carry full of corn for the chickens, and
bring back full of fresh eggs for breakfast. And the
child knew the relative merits of bantam, dominicho, duck-legged,
or Spanish broods, as well as their mistress. Shanghais
and Cochin Chinas were unheard of in that day.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mrs. Lyon’s pride of prides was her drove of cows—unexcelled
and even unapproached in all the country around.
And to these especially, the old lady often gave her personal
attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>And whenever she walked down to the cow-pen in the
afternoon milking-time, to see for herself that her cows
were in a good condition, and that her milk-maids did their
duty faithfully, little Drusilla walked behind her, with a
little basket in her hand full of small, sweet apples to treat
the pets. And with her own little hand she would hold a
small apple up to the great mouth of some prize cow, and
laugh to see the long red tongue thrust out and folded
around the morsel to be crunched up by the teeth. And
the child knew the name and pedigree of every prodigious
prize cow there, and could tell the distinctive points of the
Durham, Alderney, Ayrshire, or other breeds.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>In a word she became the old lady’s “shadow,” and she
learned all the old lady could teach her without giving her
teacher the least trouble, but on the contrary a great deal
of assistance. She gained much practical knowledge, if
but little book learning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Strangers who saw them together invariably took the
little girl to be the old lady’s grand-daughter; and Mrs.
Lyon was always rather pleased by the mistake.</p>

<p class='c011'>And little Drusilla was “as happy as the day was long.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So passed the spring and half the summer.</p>

<p class='c011'>But in the middle of July the chief justice and his wife
went to the mountains, to old Lyon Hall, on a visit to the
general and his daughter, where they expected to be joined
by Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Drusilla wept over the departure of her friends;
but when they were gone she occupied herself with the
commissions Mrs. Lyon had left to her—left with the purpose
of interesting and amusing the lonely child during her
own absence. These were to weed the flower beds, feed the
chickens, and take small sweet apples to the favorite cows
at the afternoon milking-time.</p>

<p class='c011'>All these pleasant tasks did the little girl gladly and
faithfully perform.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless the days seemed long, now that her dear
old friends were gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>But days and weeks, however tedious, pass away in time.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of six weeks, on the first of September, the
chief justice and his wife come back to Crowood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Lyon could not enough praise the fidelity of her
little handmaiden. There was not a weed to be found in
all the flower beds; the chickens were fat, and the cows in
a good condition (though this last item was of course due
more to the fine grazing than to the little treats of sweet
apples tendered to them by the little Drusilla.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The old lady and the child became better friends than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>ever. Mrs. Lyon had a great deal to tell about Mr. Alexander,
and little Drusilla was never tired of listening.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so three more pleasant months were passed at Crowood,
and then the family went back to the city. They
were comfortably settled in their town house by the first of
December.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Lyon went out in the carriage to shop, and took
Drusilla, and purchased for her pretty, bright colored merino
dresses, suitable for childhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Christmas came, and brought General Lyon, Miss Anna
and Mr. Alexander, on their annual visit. And Mr. Richard
Hammond came, an uninvited but not an unwelcome
guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Drusilla was now always with Mrs. Lyon. The
housekeeper had fairly given the child up to the old lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mr. Alexander, who, on this occasion was the first
of the Christmas party to arrive, found Drusilla in the
drawing-room, neatly dressed in a crimson merino frock,
with a ruffled white apron, and with her pretty hair curled
and tied back with crimson ribbons.</p>

<p class='c011'>After affectionately greeting his mother and father, he
turned to the child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why—is this? No, it isn’t. Yes, it is actually my
little Drusilla. Why, what a bright little bird you have
grown, to be sure!” he exclaimed, snatching her up in his
arms and kissing her boisterously, as she clung around his
neck, smiling in delight, and timidly hiding her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I will say, mother, she does you credit. You
have quite transfigured her. What have you been doing
to her to improve her so much?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Giving her a little more sunshine, that is all, Alick,”
smiled the old lady, greatly pleased because the son of
her old age was so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I declare I never saw such a change in any creature.
I left her a year ago, a dingy little chimney swallow. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>come back, and find her a brilliant oriole. Indeed, I didn’t
know her at first, and I shouldn’t have known her at all,
but for her eyes and forehead; <i>they</i> will never change. I
say, father, by the way, talking of her forehead, look at it.
If there be any truth in phrenology <i>she</i> must have intellect.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t think it requires an appeal to phrenology to
prove that the child has rare intelligence,” said the chief
justice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Intellect is a snare as well as beauty; goodness is the
quality most to be desired,” remarked Mrs. Lyon, gravely.
Then, speaking to the child, she added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now run away into the garden and play for half an
hour or so. This clear, frosty air outside is good for little
girls.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alexander put his pet down, and then the little
creature ran out of the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must beg you both, my husband and son, not to say
such things as you have been saying in the child’s presence
again. I have too real a regard for her to wish to have her
spoiled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, mother; I wouldn’t do anything to spoil her
for the world,” said Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the chief justice also acquiesced, for the old lady
was queen-regnant in her own family kingdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>An hour later General Lyon and Miss Anna arrived.
And at night Mr. Richard made his appearance. And
with the coming of Dick the holidays really commenced.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Christmas morning a great many presents were interchanged.
And while rich jewelry, furs, shawls, dresses,
laces, slippers, caps, gowns and gloves were given and received,
little Drusilla ran from one group to another, deeply
interested and sincerely sympathizing in the pleasure and
satisfaction of her friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not forgotten you this time, little one; see here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>what a lot of pretty stories to read these long winter evenings,”
said Mr. Alick, unwrapping a parcel from which he
took a large volume of “Fairy Tales,” profusely illustrated
with splendidly colored engravings.</p>

<p class='c011'>What child’s heart does not dote on Fairy Tales and on
colored pictures?</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Drusilla’s eyes fairly leaped with joy, and she caught
the young man’s hand and kissed it eagerly, and pressed it
to her heart, and put it on her head. Apparently she could
not do enough to express how much she was obliged to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, nonsense; I’m not the Emperor of Morocco or
Khan of Tartary, to be worshipped after that fashion,”
laughed the young man, “and my knuckles must be knobby
sort of kissing. Up here, crimson lips, and kiss me on the
mouth, if nothing but kissing will relieve your mind.
Come, Miss Anna won’t be jealous, not now, at least, though
I don’t know what she might be if you were seventeen instead
of seven.” And he took her up in his arms, and
kissed her very fondly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now see here,” he said, as he put her down again,
“here is something else I have got for you—a pretty little
<i>papier mâché</i> writing desk, furnished completely. See,
here is an inkstand and a sand box, here are pens of several
sizes, and pencils of all qualities, and here are envelopes
and note-paper of every color and shade. Now I
know you can write a little, as well as read a great deal.
So, when I go away again, I want you, instead of sending
me messages, to write me nice little notes, and give them to
my mother, and she will put them inside of hers, and send
them to me. Do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir,” said the child, gravely, as the tears stole
down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, then, what are you crying for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because you are so good to me, and—and you are going
away again, and I shall not see you for—for—for a year,”
sobbed the little Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“Whe-ew! here’s borrowing trouble! Why, I shall not
go for six weeks yet, and who knows but the world may
come to an end before that time, and we may all go to
Heaven together? Come, stop crying. What! you can’t?
Hey day! Do you love me as much as all that comes
to?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir,” sobbed the child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, if you do love me, mind what I say, and
stop crying. It blubbers your face all up, and makes you
ugly, and I couldn’t possibly love an ugly little girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla wiped her eyes by rubbing her fists into them,
and then, little woman-like, turned her head aside, and stole
a furtive glance at the mirror opposite, to see if she had
made herself as ugly as Mr. Alexander said, and finding
that she <i>had</i>, she began to compose herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in a few minutes afterwards she seemed deeply interested
in sorting the contents of her writing desk.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was one of the merriest Christmas seasons that the
young people of the Lyon family ever passed. The weather
was very fine. Everybody was in good health and high
spirits. Amusements were many and various. And where-ever
the young party went they took little Drusilla with
them. She was the family pet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bright seasons must terminate, as well as dark ones, and
the merry Christmas holidays came to an end, and the
happy Christmas party separated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again little Drusilla was inconsolable, until time reconciled
her to the absence of her friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she obeyed his order, given half in jest and half in
earnest. She wrote a little letter to him to be put in every
one that his mother sent. And real love-letters they were
too, though scratched in the most awkward of infantile
hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I love you so; I do love you so much; I do love you
more than anybody in the world; every time I say my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>prayers I thank Our Father for making you, and I pray to
Him to bless you and to keep you good. And I do all you
tell me to do, and it makes me feel glad. And I don’t do
what you tell me not to do. And when anybody wants me
to do anything well that is hard, they speak your name and
then it seems easy for me. I let mother cut off all my long
curls and did not cry, for she said that my hair would grow
out so much nicer by the time you come back. But oh,
how long it will be before you come back. But I won’t cry
after you, for you say it makes me ugly and you couldn’t
love an ugly little girl. Mother says I must not wish to be
pretty; but oh, I do, because you like pretty people. But
if I am good you will always like me, won’t you? Is there
any little girl at college that you like as well as me?
You’ve got the little dog, I know. You took him with you.
To think you could take the little dog and couldn’t take me.
It does seem hard, because I love you, oh so much more
than the little dog could. I’m not jealous of the poor little
dog; don’t think that, only it seems so hard, when I love
you so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the sort of ardent nonsense the little child
wrote to her big hero; but after all, it was no worse
nonsense than many of her grown-up sisters write to the
heroes of <i>their</i> imaginations.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Mrs. Lyon never looked into little Drusilla’s scrawls—or,
if she did, she never took the trouble to decipher
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alick would smile over them; because they pleased
him. He liked to be loved. The preference of any dumb
brute was pleasing to him; how much more so then the
worship—for it was little less—of this fervent, earnest,
enthusiastic little girl?</p>

<p class='c011'>“How devoted to me the little quiz is, to be sure.
Christopher Columbus! if this sort of thing should grow
with her growth and strengthen with her strength, what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>will become of me? Bosh! by the time she is seventeen
or eighteen some young prig of a parson will cut me out
and there an end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mr. Alick laughed at the conceit, and thought of the
black-eyed girl he had danced with at the last party.</p>

<p class='c011'>But for all that he could not do without the child’s love
or the child’s letters; and he cherished both.</p>

<p class='c011'>This first year of Drusilla’s life with the Lyon family
was a sample of several that followed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every Spring the family went to Crowood, taking the
housekeeper and her child and all the servants with them;
and Drusilla renewed her acquaintance with woods and
fields and streams; and increased her knowledge of plants,
poultry, cows, and animate and inanimate nature generally,
from personal observation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every midsummer she was left princess regent of the
poultry yard, etc., while her benefactors went to visit their
relatives in Old Lyon Hall in the mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every autumn the family returned to Richmond to spend
the winter.</p>

<p class='c011'>And every Christmas came the grand family re-union, in
which, to the child’s worshipping eyes, Mr. Alexander was
the central figure. This Christmas gathering became to
her the crowning glory of the year, for then she saw him.
He became thus associated with all that was best and
brightest in her life. He brought her the books and
pictures for which already her intellect and imagination
had begun to hunger. He always examined into the progress
of her education; though that was scarcely necessary,
for the constantly improving style of her letters to him
revealed her steady advance. I believe that with her bright
intelligence, she would have studied well from the pure love
of knowledge, even if Mr. Alexander had never patronized
her; but now all cooler motives were lost in the ardent
desire to please her friend. And indeed she did please
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>him; he was proud of her, vain of her, not as if he had
been her father, but as if he had been her creator. He
seemed to think, as she grew in beauty and bright intelligence,
that he had made her what she was. To his apprehension,
he was the sun and she the sun-flower, ever turning
towards him for light and life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every one, who is not blindly selfish, likes to patronize
where to do so costs little or nothing. Mr. Alexander’s patronage
of this child amused and interested him; cost him
nothing; but won for him a vast return of love and gratitude.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At ten years of age little Drusilla met her first great
grief; and very heavy it was, for it nearly crushed out her
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alexander being twenty-two years of age, and
having completed his college course, graduated with some
honors, and returned home to spend a week or two of the
beautiful spring weather with his parents previous to starting
on his travels.</p>

<p class='c011'>The family had not yet left the town house in Richmond,
where General Lyon and Miss Anna, now a blooming young
lady of sixteen, came to visit them.</p>

<p class='c011'>During this visit it was arranged that Mr. Alexander
should travel for two years and then return and marry
Miss Anna, and that the young couple should take up
their permanent abode at Old Lyon Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>But in all the interest and excitement of arranging his
own and his promised bride’s affairs, Alexander did not
neglect Drusilla. He had come into a little property of his
own, left him by a bachelor brother of his mother; and so
before he went away he said to the old lady:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother, little Drusilla is going on eleven years old and
ought to be sent to school. And I wish you, if you please,
to look out a good one for her, the best that can be found,
and send her. I wish you to do this for me at my expense.
My money is in the City Bank, and I will leave you a
number of blank checks, to fill up as you may require them.
Will you attend to this for me, mother?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Lyon hesitated and pondered, and then answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Alick. I can’t refuse you anything on the eve of
a voyage. And I don’t see any harm in this—a good common
school education——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mother, not that only; but the best—the very best—that
can be got for her. See what a bright, intelligent,
industrious little creature she is,” hastily interrupted
Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What! do you mean that she shall learn languages and
music, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>—“Everything that a young lady is taught, mother.
Everything that Anna knows. Why not? Think how
small the cost, after all, to me; how great the good to
her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is true, Alick. You are really a very noble-minded
young man. I must say it, if you are my son.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bosh, mother, begging your pardon, I’m nothing of the
sort. But I like to do a good thing now and then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And this will be a good thing for her. It will enable
her to get her living as a governess.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a bit of it, mother; Heaven forbid that my child
should ever become a governess, to be teased by stupid
children and snubbed by insolent mammas.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“Then I am afraid you and Anna will have to adopt
her,” said the old lady drily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what’s to hinder us? Think what a charming
companion my child will be for Anna, and how much more
charming if she should be well educated.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you talk as if you were her father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I feel as if I was!” said the young man, as a
real tenderness softened the expression of his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day Mr. Alexander left home for his distant
travels.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one took the parting hard but his mother and his
“child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His father and his uncle shook hands with him heartily,
wishing him a good voyage. His mother held him to her
heart and prayed and wept over him. Miss Anna kissed
him with a cordial, cousinly smack, and told him not to
forget her in foreign parts.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when he lifted Drusilla up, as he had been accustomed
to do, and kissed her on the mouth once, twice,
thrice, and said feelingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot do this when I come back again, my child!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She clung to his bosom and gasped, but could make no
reply, she was so suffocated with grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>He set her down very gently and went away.</p>

<p class='c011'>The general and the judge looked for the morning papers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Anna sat down to cut the leaves of a new novel.</p>

<p class='c011'>But old Miss Lyon took the hand of the pale, tearless,
motionless child, and led her away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Drusilla, sensitive, impressible and inexperienced,
dropped under the heavy blow that had fallen on her with
all the force of a first great sorrow. She fell ill, nearly
unto death, moaning, in her semi-delirium, snatches of her
grief:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t go! don’t go! Two years—two long, long
years! Oh! so far away! His man could go with him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and not I—not I who will die about it! Oh, come back!
come back, or I will die—indeed I will die!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Lyon soothed this distress as well as she was able,
and when, after weeks of illness, the little girl grew better,
the old lady told her of all Mr. Alexander’s plans for her
welfare—that he had decided she must be sent to school and
educated like a young lady; that afterwards she was to be
taken to live as a companion to Miss Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla listened very humbly and gratefully to this communication;
but much as she loved knowledge, and anxious
as she was to acquire it, she felt too bereaved and sorrowful
to take delight in that or in anything else, as yet.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as the child recovered her health, she was fitted
out and put to one of the best boarding schools in the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her mother made no objection, only mumbled to herself
this piece of philosophy:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If we don’t know much of the future, of this we may
be certain—when we expect anything to turn out <i>this</i> way,
it will be sure to turn out <i>that</i>. I thought the child was
going to be a nuisance and a bore, and behold! she is a
treasure and a pet! And so it is with everything!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And meanwhile, with one great bond of sympathy between
them, the old lady and the little girl grew faster
friends than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>But her devotion to Alexander—it grew with her
growth and strengthened with her strength. It was her
one faith, hope, love—her inspiration, her religion, her
soul; it was a part of herself—no, her <i>very</i> self—this all-absorbing,
all-concentrating, all-devoting love to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>His bosom was her home, though he might never let
her into it; what the nest is to the bird his bosom was
to her—the bourne of all her thoughts, the safe and
happy resting-place of her heart, though as yet she was
an exile from it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sphere of study was around her; it did not govern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>her, but served her, for all that she could get from
it was drawn in to help the one great moving power
of her being. She loved learning so much for his sake,
that she did not know whether she loved it for its own.
Her expanding intellect seemed only her enlarging love.
Her advancement in knowledge seemed only to be progress
towards him.</p>

<p class='c011'>She seemed to herself to belong to him—to have been
made <i>for</i> him, made <i>of</i> him, almost <i>by</i> him. She was
as the rib taken from her Adam’s side, conscious of her
dislocation, and longing to be put back again, and made
one with the life of her life. If Alexander had died at
this time, I think that Drusilla would have ceased to
live.</p>

<p class='c011'>One other such case as hers I have seen in common life,
and that must be nameless, and one I have met in history,
the love of the child-queen, Isabella, for her grown-up consort,
Richard II. And that there are many other instances
of such devotion, I have no doubt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla remained at the “Irving Institute” for nearly
three years. With her love of knowledge and desire for
improvement, her quick perception and retentive memory,
her progress in education was both easy and rapid.</p>

<p class='c011'>As yet she had not seen enough of the world to know
herself by comparison with others, so there were some
things in her school life that gently moved her wonder;
first, in the study hours, to see that the pursuits which were
pastime and delight to her, were labor and vexation to most
of her classmates; and second, at the school parties, to
which the younger brothers of the pupils were invited, to
see girls of her own age actually engaged in flirtations with
boys who were no older than themselves, and who seemed
to her, to be children.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the great religion, idolatry—call the passion what
you will—that inspired her soul, she could not understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>such silliness in her companions, and therefore, pretty and
intelligent as she was, her reserve made her somewhat unpopular.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wrote to Mr. Alexander every week, because he had
requested her to do so and she had promised, and also
because writing to him was the greatest pleasure she had
in this world except receiving his letters.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wrote to him regularly every week, as I said; and
about once in two months, on an average, she got a letter
from him; but she could not complain for his mother got
one no oftener, and both made excuses for him; he had “so
much to engage his attention,” they said.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, when he had been gone more than two years,
the letters ceased, or seemed to cease, altogether. Several
months passed, and nothing was heard of Mr. Alexander.
His father opined that he had passed over into Africa,
where post-offices were few, and mails doubtful, and hoped
that he would soon return into a more civilized section of
the world, from which he would write to his relations.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Mrs. Lyon grieved and complained. She was sure
that he had been killed by the Arabs of the Desert, or sold
into slavery by the Algerine pirates.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla pined in silence, or if she opened her mouth to
speak upon the subject, it was to try to encourage her old
friend, and herself also. She told Mrs. Lyon that Bedouin
outrages and Barbary piracies were horrors belonging to
the past. She showed her the modern map of Africa, and
pointed out how few and far apart were the points from
which letters could be sent home, and she sought to demonstrate
that the absence of post-offices and mail routes was
the all-sufficient cause of the silence of the traveller in
Africa. Thus she succeeded in cheering the old lady; and
whenever Mrs. Lyon felt more discouraged than usual, she
always sought Drusilla to be comforted by her.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon thought as the judge thought, that Alexander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>being in Africa could not write home; and he wished
as the judge did, that the wanderer might soon return to
Europe, civilization, and post-offices.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Anna never troubled her head about the matter.
She was his promised wife, and so his mother hoped that he
might write to her, if to no one else. And Mrs. Lyon often
wrote to Anna, to ask if she had heard from Alick yet.
And Anna always answered—“I have not had a letter from
him for ages. <i>He has forgotten me.</i>” And Anna’s “wish
was father to this thought.” And furthermore, she advised
her correspondent not to be uneasy. Alick, she thought,
would come back safe in time, no doubt.</p>

<p class='c011'>People who are not anxious can be so rational!</p>

<p class='c011'>But at length suspense was ended.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was early in December. The judge and Mrs. Lyon
were in their town house, looking forward to the annual
Christmas visit of the general and Miss Lyon, when the
old lady received a letter from her son. It was dated from
Paris, and contained the joyful news that he had returned
from Africa in perfect health and spirits, and was going
over to Southampton to take the first steamer bound for
New York; and that soon after they should get his letter
they might expect him in person.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Lyon, after reading this letter to her husband, and
receiving his comment:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I told you so. I shall be glad when he is safe at
home, though;” hurried off to the Irving Institute, to tell
the joyful news to the only one from whom she would be
sure of perfect sympathy, in this her great happiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sent for Drusilla into the reception parlor, and told
her all the news, and then read the letter to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl clung to her old friend and wept with delight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This letter came by the steamer that got into New
York harbor on Wednesday. This is Friday, and there is
another due this week! He may be in it!” said Mrs.
Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“There is another due now, and he will be sure to be in
it. Think, madam, the steamer that brought this letter
should have been in last Saturday. The steamer that
should have followed it in order must be at her pier now.
We may expect Mr. Alexander by every train,” said Drusilla,
as soon as she had recovered her composure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is true! So we may! And, my dear child, you
always say something to comfort or delight me! And you
shall go home with me directly, so as to be there to welcome
him when he arrives. There is nobody in the world he
will be gladder to see. And this is Friday afternoon, and
of course there are to be no lessons Saturday or Sunday,
and so you can just as well as not go home with me and
stay over until Monday. I will speak to the principal
about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she rung the bell, and desired the parlor-maid
who answered it to take her respects to Mrs. Irving, and
say that she should be pleased to see her in the parlor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told the judge to write to the general, and let him
and Anna know that Alick was expected every day, so they
might hasten their coming. But la! you know, my dear,
these cross-country mails are so slow, it will be impossible
for them to receive the letter in time to get here to welcome
him on his first arrival. However, I know they will come
as soon as ever they can. And I suppose we may prepare
for a gay wedding soon. And no doubt you will be one of
the bridesmaids. You are quite old enough—nearly thirteen,
and I like the bridesmaids to be much younger than
the brides.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the delighted old lady twaddled on until the door
opened, and Mrs. Irving entered the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Mrs. Lyon soon told her news and made her boon.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the accomplished principal warmly congratulated
her visitor, and graciously granted the request.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla left the parlor to prepare for her ride, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>in ten minutes returned, ready to accompany Mrs. Lyon
home.</p>

<p class='c011'>They reached the house in time for the old lady to hustle
into the housekeeper’s room, and order sundry dishes of
oysters, poultry, game, pastry, cakes and jellies added to
the bill of fare for supper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For you know he may arrive by the nine o’clock train—that
is the first one in,” said the old lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who may arrive, Madam?” inquired the housekeeper,
who had not heard one word of the good news.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My son, to be sure, you stupid woman—who else?”
exclaimed Mrs. Lyon, delightedly. And then she poured
forth the news of the letter she had received from him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” said Mrs. Sterling. And she turned and kissed
her daughter, inquiring:</p>

<p class='c011'>“How came you out of school?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madame brought me home with her to welcome—my
benefactor,” answered Drusilla, returning her mother’s kiss.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh,” said the housekeeper a second time. “Well, I’m
going to be very busy to get up all these dishes in time for
supper, so don’t interrupt me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I not help you?” asked Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, you would only hinder me. I have no time to
direct new hands now,” answered her mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come with me, Drusilla, my dear, and we will go and
see that his rooms are opened and aired,” said the old lady,
beckoning to her favorite.</p>

<p class='c011'>They went up stairs together, attended by Mary, the
colored housemaid. This girl herself could have done the
duty well enough alone; or at most with the instruction of
either Mrs. Lyon or Drusilla; but both chose to see to the
work and make it a labor of love.</p>

<p class='c011'>The handsome bed-chamber, with dressing-room and bath
attached, was opened and aired. A fine fire of sea coal was
lighted in the polished steel grate. His rich dressing gown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>was taken out from the sandal-wood chest into which it had
been packed with sundry other garments he had left at
home: and it was shaken well and hung over the resting
chair beside the fire. His slippers were laid upon the rug.
A complete and well-dried change of clothing was spread
out upon the bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For you see, my dear, his luggage may not be here for
hours after he arrives; and he will want to change his
dusty travelling suit for clean clothes as soon as possible, so
as to be sweet and nice and comfortable for the evening,”
said Mrs. Lyon, as she laid a couple of fresh, scented
pocket-handkerchiefs beside his other personal equipments.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then fine soap and fresh towels were laid upon his wash-stand.
And the Bohemian glass bottles on his dressing-table were filled—one with Cologne water and the other
with Macassar oil. Finally the wax candles each side the
glass were lighted. And then, after a glance around to see
that all was right, Mrs. Lyon called Drusilla and the housemaid
to come after her, and left the apartment.</p>

<p class='c011'>She passed to her own chamber and put on her best
black moire antique dress, and her finest point lace cap and
collar.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then she went down into the drawing-room to wait
for her son.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And after all, we have no assurance that he will come
to-night. We do not even know that the steamer is in, or
if it is, that he is aboard,” sighed the aged mother impatiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will come to-night, Madam. In one hour he will
be here. I feel sure that he will,” said Drusilla, cheerfully.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>He came, even before be was expected. By some happy
chance the train was in half an hour earlier than usual.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Mrs. Lyon had gone into the “study,” to have a
chat with the judge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla was alone in the drawing-room, when a cab
dashed swiftly up to the street-door, the bell rang sharply,
and was answered quickly; and there was a pleasant bustle
of arrival in the hall, and Mr. Alexander burst into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked not fatigued or travel-stained, but flushed and
excited with exercise and anticipation.</p>

<p class='c011'>With an irrepressible cry of joy, Drusilla sprung to
meet him, and then suddenly recoiled, blushed and trembled
between delight, timidity and embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander caught her hand, gazed in her face, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why—Who are you? I ought to know. Your face
seems familiar, and yet—<span class='sc'>Drusilla</span>!” he suddenly cried,
as he recognized and caught her up in his arms, and covered
her face with kisses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Welcome! Oh, welcome!—I am so glad you have come
at last!—I never was so happy in my life!” she tried to
say, as she dropped her head upon his shoulder and wept
with delight.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“And my child is the first one to welcome me!” said
Alexander, sitting down on a sofa and drawing her upon
his knee, where she sat, painfully embarrassed yet unwilling
to move, lest she should wound his affection on this,
the first day of his return.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All are well?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite well,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, so the servant told me at the door. Where is my
mother?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just stepped from the room. I expect her back every
instant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what a beautiful girl you are growing to be!”
he said, looking down with earnest admiration at the long,
black eye-lashes that, being cast down, shaded and softened
the crimson cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come! look up at me; I wish to see if your eyes are
changed. I never could decide whether they were gray or
hazel. Let me see!” he said, putting his hand under her
chin to lift her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked up with a quick and quickly withdrawn
glance, and her cheeks deepened in their hue. She hated
to sit on his knee, where years ago she had sat a hundred
times, and she hated to hurt his feelings by leaving him;
and she doubted whether she loved him now as well as
she did then, and whether her love was not turning into
something very much like distrust and dread; and she wondered
why this should be so, and secretly blamed and disbelieved
in herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Am I so altered by travel that you don’t like to look
at me?” he asked, smilingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh no, sir, you are not altered, except to be—improved,”
she forced herself to say, with courtesy.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were interrupted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is too great a girl for that sort of thing now, Mr.
Alexander, if you please. Be so good as to put her down,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>It was the voice of the housekeeper that spoke, as she
entered the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon, Mrs. Sterling,” said Alexander,
laughing, and releasing his favorite; “but it is hard to
realize that my little pet is growing up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is thirteen, sir,” curtly answered the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear me! Is she so? Why I dandled her when she
was a baby! What an old man I am growing to be, to be
sure!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not quite old enough to be her father, Mr. Alexander,
and therefore too young to make a pet of her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, now, this is a pretty way to welcome me home
with a rebuke the first thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very glad to see you home, sir, however; and—Here
is Mrs. Lyon!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The housekeeper cut her speech short, as the old lady
entered the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my son! my son!” she cried, and fell sobbing for
joy in his arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>The housekeeper withdrew, taking her daughter with
her, and leaving the mother and son alone together.</p>

<p class='c011'>Arrived in her own room, Mrs. Sterling sat her daughter
down before her, and began to lecture her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla—she preached—must not allow Mr. Alexander
to pet her and caress her <i>now</i>, as he had done before he
went away. Drusilla was too great a girl now, for that sort
of thing. Truly, she was not a woman yet; but she was
growing into one, and so the familiarities that were quite
innocent when she was a child, would be extremely improper
now that she was almost a young woman. Such was
the purport of the sermon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla trembled excessively, and wept a little over this
exordium. In her heart she agreed with it, but grieved
over it.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was just such a lecture as any prudent mother might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>have given her growing daughter under the circumstances.
But Drusilla, while acquiescing in its propriety, was shocked
by its plainness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their interview was interrupted by the voice of Mrs.
Lyon, who came herself in search of her favorite.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you, Drusilla, my dear? Come and thank
your benefactor for all that he has done for you, and show
him how much you have profited by his kindness,” said the
old lady, as she came in.</p>

<p class='c011'>Blushing and embarrassed, the girl followed the lady to
the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alexander had changed his travelling suit for an evening
dress, and was sitting talking to Judge Lyon about the
voyage home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, at a sign from Mrs. Lyon, seated herself near
the talkers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want you to see how much your protegée has improved,
Alick,” said Alick’s mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I <i>have</i> seen, Madam,” answered Alexander with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After supper I want her to sing and play for you. She
has a wonderful proficiency in music,” said Mrs. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be glad to have a specimen of her skill,
mother,” said the young man, turning to his father, and
taking up the thread of the broken conversation, in order
to relieve Drusilla, who was embarrassed by all this notice.</p>

<p class='c011'>What between her own half-consciousness and her
mother’s severe lecture, Drusilla was perplexed and distressed.
The great pleasure she had anticipated from the
arrival of Alexander was mixed with strange pain—a pain
not the less poignant because she could not understand it.
To become the cold and formal stranger to him that her
mother wished her to be, seemed impossible; while to continue
the familiar child-pet that she had hitherto been to
him was not to be thought of. If he had only been her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>brother, so that she might have had a right to his caresses,
how happy she could have been, she dared to think.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as it was, she could scarcely venture to glance at
him, because each glance thrilled her soul with such
strange, wild emotion, half delight, half dread. Ah,
friends, she was a child of the sun, fervent, earnest,
devoted in all her ardent soul. She was already, all unknown
to herself, deeply and passionately attached to Alexander
Lyon. The budding love of years had this evening
burst into full bloom. And yet it was even more religion
than love, and more worship than passion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Supper was announced and every one arose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, Drusilla, you are the only young lady present,”
said Alexander, taking her hand to lead her in to supper.</p>

<p class='c011'>He felt that small hand flutter and throb within his own
like the heart of a captured bird. He turned suddenly and
looked at her. Her eyes were cast down, and her cheeks
were crimson. He gazed on her for a moment in grave
silence, and then slightly frowning, led her on into the dining
room, and placed her in a chair at the table. He paid
her all due attention at the supper, but with a certain
reserve that he had never used with her before.</p>

<p class='c011'>The evening meal was, notwithstanding this, a very
happy one.</p>

<p class='c011'>The judge chatted gaily with his restored son, encouraging
him to talk of his wanderings in the old world.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old lady listened with pleased attention, and only
once in a while broke her silence to ask whether he had
been presented to all the queens in Europe, and which was
the most beautiful woman among them, or some such question
as that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her son answered that he saw no woman in Europe prettier
than some he found at home; and he glanced at Drusilla
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl beaming in the light of his countenance, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>drinking in the music of his voice was intensely happy and—vaguely
wretched.</p>

<p class='c011'>When supper was over they went back into the drawing-room,
and Mrs. Lyon made Drusilla sit down to the pianoforte
and play and sing for Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>He shrugged his shoulders at the proposition, but politely
acquiesced and prepared to be bored. Alexander was a
connoisseur in music, and he had heard the very best
singers of the day. Consequently he had little patience
with the crude efforts of young misses.</p>

<p class='c011'>She, Drusilla, began with a very simple song—chosen in
compliment to the newly-arrived son:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Home again! home again! from a foreign shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And oh, it fills my soul with joy to meet my friends once more.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At first her voice trembled slightly; but the tremor only
added to its pathos; and as she went on it gained strength
and volume. She sang with much feeling and expression.
And Alexander was surprised, and pleased and profoundly
affected.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My child, you sing well; I tell you so, who have heard
the best singers in the world. Your voice has reached the
depths of my heart, Drusilla, and awakened it to a deeper
consciousness of its joy in home-coming,” he whispered as
she finished her song.</p>

<p class='c011'>She bowed her head, partly in meek acknowledgment
of this praise, and partly to conceal the blush that overspread
her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that little song is very pretty and very appropriate,
but it is nothing to what she can do. Sing Casta Diva, my
dear,” said Mrs. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla raised an imploring glance to the old lady’s face,
but met with no reprieve there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, my dear! the Casta Diva!” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a deprecating look at Alexander the girl took down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>another volume of music, and turned to the selections from
Norma. The piece chosen by Mrs. Lyon was a great trial
to any immature and half-cultivated voice like Drusilla’s,
however excellent the quality of that voice might naturally
be; and Drusilla knew this, and thence her imploring and
deprecating glances.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are too exacting, mother. She cannot sing that;
I do not think any woman under thirty years old could,
unless she had had a very remarkable and precocious experience,”
said Alexander, laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, you say that because you know nothing of the intuitions
of genius. You must hear your protégée sing, and
you will understand better,” said Mrs. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus urged on, Drusilla began to sing. Her voice arose
tremulously, as at first, like a young bird fluttering out of
its nest, but then it soared and swelled, gaining power and
volume, until it filled all the air with the music of that
wild, impassioned, agonized, terrible invocation and appeal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Certainly Drusilla had never known remorse, anguish or
despair, yet all these wailed forth in her soul-thrilling
tones.</p>

<p class='c011'>She ceased, and dropped her head, exhausted, on her
book.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander made no comment, but took her hand and led
her from the instrument, and then went and resolutely shut
it down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There! what do you think of that?” demanded the
old lady, triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you some other time,” said Alexander, and he
took and lighted a bedroom candle, and put it into Drusilla’s
hand, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good night! go to bed, my child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla took the light and turned to the old lady, and
held up her face for a kiss.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mrs. Lyon stooped and touched her lips, saying,
with a smile:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“I suppose I may kiss you <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander held the door open until the girl had passed
out, and then he shut it after her and returned to his seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know, Alick, why I said to Drusilla just now,
‘I suppose I may kiss you <i>now</i>?’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’ll tell you. You remember how you kissed her
when you went away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Alick! your departure nearly killed your poor little
pet. If you had been her own father, she could not have
grieved after you more than she did. She had a low fever,
and after she got well she would not let any one kiss her.
She said that you had kissed her last, and that no one else
should touch her lips until you should return and kiss her
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did she now, really,” exclaimed Alexander, with emotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She did indeed, and she kept her word.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander reflected a moment, and then spoke:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell her teachers that I do not wish and will not permit,
Drusilla to learn opera music or love songs. Let her
confine herself to sacred music only.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But Alick, my son, how absurd! I am particular
enough, the dear knows, but I don’t see any harm in good
opera music. All young ladies learn it, and you desired
that she should learn all that young ladies do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was hasty; and now I say that she must give up
opera music and such like. Let her learn and practice
sacred music to her heart’s content and her soul’s salvation.
Let music be the means, not of drawing her affections
down to earthly follies, but of fixing them more steadfastly
upon heavenly things.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“Alick, you do astonish me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I astonish myself, sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray have you got religion, as the phrase goes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I wish to the Lord I had. But I want her to
have it. Mother!” he said, with sudden energy, going
towards the old lady, “you don’t know <i>how</i> I love that
child; you can’t feel how I love her—how near and dear
she seems to me—how near and dear she has always seemed
since I first looked into her soft, sweet, patient eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe you love her as much as if you were her
father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her father! well, I suppose my affection for her has
something paternal in it, but fathers seldom love their
daughters as I love her. Instance: Fathers are willing to
give their daughters away in marriage, but I am very sure
that I would rather see Drusilla dead than married.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old lady stared at the young man, utterly unable to
comprehend him. He continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother, I tremble for that child. I trembled when I
heard her sing that Casta Diva as I never heard a good or
happy woman sing it. There could not have been <i>memory</i>—there
must have been <i>prophecy</i> in those wild, despairing
wails.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was intuition, and nothing more. But you have
been to Germany, and I suppose you have grown mystical,”
said Mrs. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By which you mean mad. Very likely. Perhaps my
previsions are illusions: but mother, I nevertheless must
<i>insist</i> that Drusilla shall drop opera and take up church
music. Let her teachers know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly, Alick. And now light my candle and wake
up your father; it is bed time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander lighted and handed the wax taper to his
mother, and then gently roused his father, who had been
comfortably napping in his easy chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the trio separated and went to rest.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On Saturday morning Alexander walked out to renew his
acquaintance with his native city.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Lyon said to her pet:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you know any very fine sacred music, my dear, I
wish you would select some pieces and practice them this
forenoon, so as to be able to execute them well this evening
for Alexander.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla, glad to have her morning’s work laid out,
sat down to go over portions of Handel’s Messiah.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander came home to luncheon, and in the afternoon
attended his mother and Drusilla for a drive.</p>

<p class='c011'>They dined and tea’d together, and adjourned to the
drawing-room, where, at Mrs. Lyon’s command, Drusilla
sat down to the piano and sang to her own accompaniment
on the instrument the all glorious “Te Deum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander was enraptured. It is scarcely too much to
say that he was transported—listening to the heavenly
notes of her voice and gazing on the inspired beauty of her
face. As for her she seemed all unconscious of everything
around her, as though her soul were winging its way to
Heaven in those strains of divine music.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the last notes of her voice died away, there was
silence in the room for some moments. It was gently
broken by Alexander murmuring in her ear:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“My child, sacred music is your forte. Consecrate your
glorious gift to the worship of the Most High.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla bowed her head; and after a few moments said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“They want me to sing in the choir of St. John’s church.
Would you like me to do so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My child, that must be as you please. Would you like
it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed I do not know until I hear your will,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I will you to sing there,” he smiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I am sure I shall like it,” she said. “And now
shall I sing the Hallelujah for you, and will you help me?
There should be four voices, though.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You shall sing no more to-night, my bird; but come to
the centre table, where I have some gleanings of travel to
show you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander’s servant had in fact just placed upon the table
a large portfolio containing interesting views of natural
scenery and of works of art, collected in their travels. And
in examining these the remainder of the evening passed.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Sunday all the family went to St. John’s church together.
But as Drusilla was not yet a member of the choir
she sat in the Lyons’ pew.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Monday morning, Mr. Alexander himself took his
protegée back to her school. He was known there as a
“patron,” and his request that his young ward, Miss Sterling,
should confine her musical studies to the sacred branch
of the art, met with a prompt acquiescence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving Drusilla under the charge of her teachers, he returned
to his home to find it very dreary in the absence of
his “child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A letter from your uncle, the general,” said Mrs. Lyon,
as she received him in the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He says that Anna declines to hasten her visit upon
‘any gentleman’s account;’ and so they will not be with
us before Christmas eve.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“Humph!” said Mr. Alexander, seating himself with
much indifference.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know that I can blame her. Certainly it is
not <i>her</i> place to run after <i>you</i>, Alick, even if she <i>is</i> your
promised bride. She must stand upon her dignity, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, well, just as she pleases; but I cannot but compare
her with one who consults her heart and not her dignity
where I am concerned.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be a coxcomb, Alick, my dear. You mean little
Drusa? She’s a child and has everything to learn yet of
proper self-respect in her association with gentlemen. But
we are not talking of her just now. I hate to send you
from me, Alick; but I really do think you are bound to
pay Anna the respect of going to Old Lyon Hall. I
would go myself, if I felt equal to the journey, and take
you as an escort; but as I am, I must let you go alone.
There is a coach leaves to-morrow at seven in the morning.
What do you think of taking a place in it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would as lief as not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Upon my word! If Anna is as indifferent in this
matter as you are, I think it is a pity you two were ever
betrothed,” said the old lady, looking over the tops of her
spectacles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our betrothal is such an old story, mother, and we are
used to it. Besides it rests upon such a solid foundation—having
one foot upon Crowood and the other on Old Lyon
Manor—that we feel secure in it. And wherever there is
security there must be indifference.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where did you learn to sneer, Alick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not sneering. Heaven forbid. My Cousin Anna
is a beautiful and accomplished young lady, for whom I have
great respect and esteem. When I see her I shall press
her to name an early day for the nuptials. And no doubt
we shall get along as well as most people.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“Humph! when <i>I</i> was young lovers were in love. I suppose
you have ‘changed all that now.’ Pray, Alick, did you
see any lady in Europe whom you very much admired?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, of course, mother! Scores and scores! But
they are last summer’s leaves and blossoms, dispersed and
forgotten. At least I shall bring to my bride a heart
single to her service. For if I am not madly in love
with Anna, I am not in love with any one else, unless
you call my fatherly fondness for little Drusilla—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense!” shortly interrupted the old lady—“that
child! Don’t be profane, Alick. Have some reverence for
innocence like hers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Alexander fidgetted and made no answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I didn’t mean to scold you, dear; only I would
have you respect holy childhood, and let a girl be a child as
long as possible. I hope and believe that you and Anna
will make a happy couple. When you see her, of course
you will say everything that is kind to her from me; and
be sure you cannot say too much. You will either prevail
on them to come immediately to us, or you will stay with
them until they are ready to do so,” said Mrs. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander agreed to everything she proposed.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then their interview was interrupted by the entrance
of some visitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning Alexander went up the country to old
Lyon Hall, where he used his powers of persuasion to such
good purpose as to prevail on Miss Anna, and of course on
her grandfather, to return with him immediately to Richmond.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he will not go back with us, we must go with him, I
suppose, grandpa. It would be a pity to deprive Aunt
Lyon of her son’s society by keeping him here, so soon after
his arrival from foreign parts,” said Miss Anna, expressing
a sentiment with which the old gentleman sincerely sympathized.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>So the whole party reached the city by the following
Saturday.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Christmas holidays were spent as merrily as ever before.
Drusilla was brought from school to join in the festivities
of the season, and she was loaded with presents and
caresses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Richard Hammond also came, and was quite as much
up to every species of fun and frolic as ever he had been in
his earlier boyhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was very much with Anna, but neither her lover nor
her relations seemed to take any exception to his attendance.
She was so nearly married now that there could be no danger
of his supplanting her betrothed, and besides, he was
her near cousin, poor fellow, they argued, and so Mr. Dick
was allowed to dance attendance upon Miss Anna, while
Mr. Alexander amused and interested himself in his
“child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The wedding of the affianced pair was fixed to take place
early in the new year, at Old Lyon Hall, whither the whole
of both families would meet to do honor to the nuptials.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna, you have not invited me to the wedding,” said
Dick one day, as they stood together in the recess of the
bay window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I invite you now, Dick! Come and be Alick’s
best man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d see him drowned first, dash him! I’d sooner be his
headsman!” said the young man, grinding his teeth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then why do you wish to come to his wedding?”
asked Anna, elevating her eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did I say I ‘wished’ it? Don’t jump to conclusions,
Anna. I don’t wish it. I merely reminded you that I was
not invited. You remember the fairy that was not invited
to the princess’s christening? She came all the same, but
her christening gift proved no blessing. I shall go to your
wedding, Anna, but the wedding present that I shall lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>upon your table will be no peace-offering,” he whispered
between his white lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned pale, and then red, and then she laughed to
conceal her agitation, as she answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be melo-dramatic, whatever you are. None but
stage-struck apprentices ever are so. All that sort of thing
is obsolete. If a young man is crossed in love, he had better
marry for money. Alick and I must marry and settle
like other sensible people. He will devote himself to improving
the race of oxen and the growth of corn, and
amuse his leisure with politics; I shall draw prizes for
poultry, butter, and perhaps flowers. Life is prose, not
poetry, Dick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look at that child. <i>She</i> does not think as you do,”
said Richard, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna raised her eyes and saw, at the opposite end of the
room, in a recess filled with row above row of blooming
flowers, this group:</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander was reclining in an easy chair, holding in his
right hand a small volume, from which he was reading in a
subdued voice, and encircling with his left arm the shoulders
of his “child,” who was sitting on a low seat beside him.
His eyes were on his book, but hers were on him. Forgetting
her timidity, forgetting herself, her inspired face was
raised to his, with glowing crimson lips apart, and slender
black eyebrows arched, and large, starry eyes fixed on him,
as she listened breathlessly to his words. He finished a
sentence, and then turned to speak to her. And instantly
her eyes fell, and her color rose even to her brows.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I see; if she were a little older, or I a little more
in love, I should be jealous,” thought Anna within herself.
But she said nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of Christmas holidays Drusilla was sent back
to school.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna, under the charge of old Mrs. Lyon, did a vast deal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>of shopping in the city, besides sending to New York for
articles that could not be procured in Richmond.</p>

<p class='c011'>When all this was done, she returned with her grandfather
to Old Lyon Hall, where they were soon to be joined
by the judge and Mrs. Lyon, and Mr. Alexander, for the
wedding.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day after the general and his grand-daughter left,
Mrs. Lyon said to Mr. Alexander:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick, Anna wishes little Drusilla to be her sixth
bridesmaid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I object to that. The girl is too young to have marrying
and giving in marriage running in her head.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense, Alick, you can’t keep this affair out; of
course she knows you and Anna are about to be married.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course she does, for she has heard nothing else
talked of for a month past,” said Alexander, in a tone of
vexation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then let her be Anna’s sixth bridesmaid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, mother, if you please. It would take her from her
studies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Alexander, you forget. She must be at the wedding
any way, for it would never do to slight the child by
omitting to take her to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not see that. Let her know that it is by <i>my</i> will
that she is to be left at school, and she will easily submit
to the disappointment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Alick, I think that would be cruel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I know it to be necessary for her own sake,
mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning the father, mother and son, attended
by their men and maid servants, set out in their travelling
carriage for Old Lyon Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Travelling by easy stages, and stopping at all the most
comfortable inns on the road, to eat or sleep, they at length
arrived safely on the evening of the third day at the old
mansion.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The house was full of company, and all alight from attic
to basement. So many young friends of the bride were
staying with her for the wedding.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our city party was very cordially received. Anna herself
took the old lady to her room, and waited on her in
person. But—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Drusilla?” was one of the first questions she
asked of Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At school. Where is Dick?” he answered and retorted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At his office in the city, I suppose. But—Drusilla!
why is she not here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would not let her come. But—Dick! why is <i>he</i> not
here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would not let him come. And—Drusilla was to have
been my bridesmaid!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And—Dick was to have been my groomsman!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And here the young cousins looked in each other’s faces
and laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a merry party that gathered in the drawing-room
that evening. Young ladies and gentlemen were grouped
in small circles around various tables, engaged in diverting
parlor games of one sort or another.</p>

<p class='c011'>The general and the old lady were playing chess together.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief justice, only, complaining of cold and fatigue,
excused himself from joining in any game, though he declined
to go to bed, and sat in the most comfortable arm-chair
in the warmest corner of the fire-place, sipping hot punch
from a glass on a stand at his elbow.</p>

<p class='c011'>When his moderate glass was empty he spread his white
handkerchief over his face, and lay back in his chair and
dozed, undisturbed by all the musical chatter and silvery
laughter around him.</p>

<p class='c011'>At ten o’clock there was a tray of refreshments brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>in, and handed first to the old lady, who was served by the
general.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next the tray was handed to the judge. The servant
who carried it stood in silence for a moment, and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, sir, his honor is asleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Lyon immediately turned and playfully whisked the
handkerchief from her husband’s head and asked him what
he meant by being so rude as to fall asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no response by word or motion.</p>

<p class='c011'>She bent forward and looked in his face, and then
screamed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her scream brought all the company in alarm around
her. Her hand was on the old man’s pulse, and her face
was pale and wild with fright.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon gently replaced her in her seat, and went
back to the judge.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in one moment more it was ascertained beyond a
doubt that Chief Justice Lyon was dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>You may imagine what a terrible shock this sudden
death gave. How the wedding-party broke up in confusion
and dispersed in sadness; how the unavailing skill of the
family physician was called in, to do no more than pronounce
upon the cause of death—apoplexy; how the funeral was
solemnized in his own old ancestral halls; and how his
body was laid at last in the family vault at old Lyon Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, who had not been permitted to attend the wedding,
had been sent for to come to the funeral. She came,
sorrowing bitterly over the sudden death of one who had
been the kindest old friend to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not go back again to school. Mrs. Lyon, overwhelmed
by the loss of the life-partner with whom she had
lived so long, needed constant and affectionate attention,
and entreated that her favorite should be left with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under the circumstances of her bereavement Alexander
could refuse his mother nothing. So Drusilla remained in
attendance upon her benefactress.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>The widow, exhausted by grief and unable to travel,
staid with the general and his grand-daughter all the
winter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander, engaged in setting his late father’s family
affairs in order, preparatory to administering on his estate,
went backwards and forwards between Richmond and Old
Lyon Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Late in the following spring Mrs. Lyon went to Crowood,
taking Drusilla with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first few days at the old country-seat, where she had
passed so many tranquil, happy seasons with her lost
husband, renewed all her grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Drusilla, guided by a happy instinct, drew her out
among her flowers, and fowls, and cows and other pets and
hobbies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Most fortunately, I say, all these had been grossly
neglected during her absence, as though under the circumstances
of her bereavement, her annual visit was not expected.
And the old lady, the mourning widow, seeing the
condition of her favorites, ceased to weep like Niobe, and
began to scold like Xantippe.</p>

<p class='c011'>And of course she got better directly.</p>

<p class='c011'>It took her and her handmaid Drusilla, assisted by a staff
of men and maids, the whole summer to bring flowers,
poultry and cows up to the old lady’s standard of perfection.
And by the time this was done her health and cheerfulness
returned.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was nothing, now that the chief justice was off the
bench forever, to call her to the city. So she determined to
make Crowood her permanent residence. With this view
she wrote to the housekeeper, who had remained in charge
of the city house, to pack up her personal effects and forward
them to Crowood, and then to come down herself, as
the house was to be put into the hands of architects, decorators,
and upholsterers, to be thoroughly renovated for the
use of the young pair, whose wedding-day was again fixed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Mrs. Lyon was the more urgent for her housekeeper to
hasten to Crowood, because there was a contagious fever of
a very malignant type raging in Richmond.</p>

<p class='c011'>In answer to her letters, Mrs. Sterling sent down, by a
wagon express, about seventy trunks, boxes and bundles,
and within a week followed them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very glad you have arrived, Sterling. I had not
an easy hour while you remained in the city, exposed to
that terrible fever. And Drusilla would have been as
anxious as I was if she had known the danger; but I kept
it concealed from her. It was of no use to trouble the
child,” Mrs. Lyon said, in welcoming her housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the poor old lady of Crowood congratulated herself
before the danger was over.</p>

<p class='c011'>Apparently, Mrs. Sterling had brought down the seeds of
fever in her system, for the day after her arrival she was
taken with a shivering fit, followed by a glow of heat, head-ache,
nausea and prostration, and in twenty-four hours she
was in a raging fever and delirium.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old lady was not a coward; she was a conscientious
Christian. Now that the fever had come, she faced it. She
sent for the country doctor, and instead of trusting the sick
woman to the care of servants, she, with Drusilla’s assistance,
nursed the patient in person. This course of conduct
was more magnanimous than prudent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Sterling, “tough as a pine knot, and with no more
nerves than it,” as the country doctor said, survived the
fever and got up, though with a broken constitution, for all
those whom that dreadful pestilence spared to life it ruined
in health.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mrs. Lyon contracted the disease, and it made but
short work with the feeble old lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the beginning of her illness her son was summoned in
haste from Richmond; but though he used his utmost speed
in hurrying to her bedside, he only arrived in time to hear
her last wishes and receive her dying blessing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“You must not grieve after me, Alick, my dear. Think
what a long and happy life I have had up to this time.
But think, now that your father is gone, how lonely I must
be. I want to be with him, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These were almost her last words. She fell into stupor
and revived only once more, long enough to lay her hand
on her son’s head and bless him.</p>

<p class='c011'>By her expressed wish her body was carried to Old Lyon
Hall, and placed in the vault beside that of her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the wedding was put off for another year.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a fatality in it. We shall never be united, or
if we should be the union will bring nothing but woe,”
said Anna to her grandfather.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait until it is put off a third time, my dear, before
you make such a fatal prediction,” answered the general.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the burial, Mr. Lyon went down to Crowood,
where his presence was necessary to the settlement of some
local business.</p>

<p class='c011'>There more melancholy news met him. Mrs. Sterling,
whose brain had been seriously affected by the fever, was
now certainly losing her reason, and Drusilla was almost
broken-hearted between the death of her dear friend and
the infirmity of her dear mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is said that madness often reverses the whole moral
character. Mrs. Sterling who, in her proper senses, had
been one of the most active, energetic and domineering of
women, was now one of the meekest, gentlest, and most
harmless of lunatics. Her illusions were all innocent, and
some of them amusing. Sometimes she fancied herself the
mistress of Crowood. At other times she imagined that
Alexander and Drusilla were married, and making a visit
to her there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her pleasing illusions did not prevent her from performing
all her household duties, only she discharged them in
the capacity of mistress, not manager.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Mr. Lyon consulted the country doctor, who told him
that in Mrs. Sterling’s case there was a gradual softening of
the brain that must prove fatal.</p>

<p class='c011'>A part of Alexander’s business at Crowood was to take
Drusilla back to school. But it was now certain that she
must not be separated from her mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>For Drusilla’s sake, he wished that Mrs. Sterling might
have the best medical advice. So he decided to take her to
Richmond, to be examined by the faculty there. But as
she persisted in imagining herself mistress of Crowood, instead
of the hired housekeeper of the master, to be directed
by his will, she refused to leave the place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Alexander, taking advantage of the hallucination
in regard to the supposed marriage of Drusilla and himself,
let a day or two pass, to enable her to forget the first proposal,
and then invited her to pay himself and her daughter
a visit at their new house in the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>This the harmless lunatic readily consented to do. And
she immediately began to prepare for the journey with a
regularity and dispatch not to be excelled by the sanest
mind. It was evident that her mental infirmity did not incapacitate
her for the functions of her office.</p>

<p class='c011'>They went to Richmond and took up their abode in the
town house, that had been thoroughly renovated and refurnished
in honor of that expected marriage which had
never yet come off.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Sterling was delighted with all she saw, and complimented
her imagined son-in-law on his taste and liberality,
and congratulated her daughter on her excellent husband
and comfortable home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Drusilla could only throw an appealing glance at
the master, which seemed to pray forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Alexander laughed and pressed her hand, as he
whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind, my dear! Perhaps her imaginings are
not <i>all</i> lunacy. They may be <i>second-sight</i>. Who knows?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>He spoke half in jest and half in earnest, and drew her
to his bosom, and held her there for a moment. But when
he felt the wild beating of her heart against his own, and
when he saw the deadly paleness of her cheek as it rested
against his breast, he suddenly released her, half repenting
his act.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Sterling seemed to think such billing and cooing
very foolish, though quite natural, between bride and
bridegroom, for as she looked at them she murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, poor souls, they think it is always going to be
just so. La! look at any middle-aged married couple you
know, and see the difference.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Mr. Lyon, holding his “child’s” hand,
stooped and whispered to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, my little darling, I hope I have not hurt
your feelings, have I?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She shook her head and tried to speak, but only gasped
instead, and hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are growing out of all this now, I know. Almost
a young woman, you are, turned fourteen, but it is hard to
think you so; you seem still to be my own precious child,”
he whispered gently.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still she did not answer, but wept softly behind her
hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusa, my daughter, you are not displeased with me,
are you? I would no more willingly displease you than I
would the highest lady in the land,” he continued.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, no, no! You could not do so. Don’t mind
me. I do not know why I weep. I don’t indeed. I am a
fool, I think.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s certain,” said Mrs. Sterling, dryly, “and so is
he. Young people are apt to be fools in their honeymoon,
but time cures them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a very dry method in the madness of Mrs.
Sterling.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>The housekeeper took possession of her old rooms, but
as they too had been re-papered, painted and furnished, she
scarcely recognized them again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla had the little chamber that had been given her
by Mrs. Lyon, and was now renovated, as a spare room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander had his own superb suit of apartments.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lyon called in the best medical science and skill to
the aid of Mrs. Sterling. But the unanimous opinion of
the faculty endorsed that of the country doctor, and there
was little hope of the patient’s recovery.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the month of December opened, Mr. Lyon wrote
to his uncle and to his betrothed, inviting them to come as
usual, and spend the Christmas holidays at his house in
Richmond, and reminding them that the meeting would be
one of a quiet family party, excluding all other visitors, and
abstaining from all gayety, in respect to the memory of the
departed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna wrote back on behalf of her grandfather and herself,
saying that she could not make a visit to a house where
there was no lady to receive her, and she begged that Alexander
would come for once and pass his Christmas at Old
Lyon Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course Mr. Lyon could do nothing but accept this invitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he dutifully went to pass the season with his promised
bride.</p>

<p class='c011'>And these were the most dismal Christmas holidays he
had ever known. He missed his genial father, his loving
mother, and yes, it must be confessed, he missed his “child,”
and he could not help contrasting the warm devotion of his
little “daughter” with the cool indifference of his promised
wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>His visit to Old Lyon Hall came to a sudden end.
He received a letter from one of the servants of the city
house.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Mrs. Sterling had died suddenly, if he pleased, and what
was to be done with Miss Drusilla?</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lyon showed that letter to Anna, made his excuses
to the general, and set off at once for Richmond.</p>

<p class='c006'>Alexander arrived at his town house early in the afternoon.
He was met by his confidential servant, Dorset, an
old man who had been in the service of the family for
nearly thirty years.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Dorset, so the poor woman is gone?” sighed the
young gentleman, as he entered the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir; and not too soon, with reverence be it spoken.
She had grown very foolish and helpless within the last few
days. She died without illness or suffering, sir. She went
to bed as usual one night and was found dead next morning.
Miss Drusilla, sleeping by her side, heard no sound
and felt no movement, and knew nothing of what had
occurred until she arose for the day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How shocking! The second sudden death in the family
within twelve months. And the third in all. Where is
the poor girl?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Drusilla? She has not left the corpse, sir, since
the death. She is watching by it now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is very wrong. It should not have been permitted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear sir, who was to hinder her? There is no one, or
I should say, there <i>was</i> no one in authority here to prevent
her.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“That is very true. But go now and tell the poor child
that I am here, waiting to see her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you go to your room first, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I came up by the boat and made my toilet just
before landing. I will wait here for Drusilla.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dorset went away with the message.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in about ten minutes, Drusilla, pale, drooping and
woe-worn, entered the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander arose and took her in his arms and silently
folded her to his bosom. And she bowed her head upon
his shoulder and wept softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My poor child! My poor, dear child, you don’t know
how sorry I am for you,” said Alexander, tenderly caressing
her, and repeating the same words over and over again,
until at length through her sobs and tears she answered
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes I do; oh, yes indeed I do know how good you are
and how much you pity us both—poor mother, dying as she
did, and—me too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Drusilla, you shall never want a friend while I
live, or a home while I have one,” he murmured, smoothing
her disordered hair with his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know that too. It is not that. I am not afraid.
But oh! if I had not slept that night, perhaps she would
not have died,” cried the girl, breaking into fresh and
passionate sobs and tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, my dearest, you talk wildly,” he said, trying
to soothe her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, no, no, I know what I am saying. If I had
only sat up and watched her that night, I might have seen
the change and saved her life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Drusilla, I learn that your poor mother was in her
usual health of body when she went to bed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, sir, so she was; else I certainly would have
sat up with her. Oh, I wish I had! I wish I had! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>would give my life now to have done it. Oh, my poor
mother! my poor dear mother. I slept on by your side and
let you die—die alone, without help, without even a word
of love. Oh, my mother!” cried the girl, utterly losing her
self-command, and weeping and sobbing and raving as if
her heart would break or her brain madden.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander let the wild gust of sorrow spend its strength,
and then he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, if you had been sitting by your mother’s bed,
gazing on her sleeping face, you would never have suspected
that she was dying and never known the moment of
her death. My child, she had a fatal malady of the brain
that was certain to end just as it did. She passed away
peacefully in her sleep. Hers was an easy death. Drusilla,
do not add causeless regrets to natural grief with these <i>ifs</i>.
Nearly all persons do so, however. I never knew any one
to die whose mourning friends did not add irrational
remorse to rational sorrow by the means of these <i>ifs</i>. <i>If</i>
we had done this; <i>if</i> we had not done that; <i>if</i> such a
doctor had been called, or such a remedy administered.
These retrospective <i>ifs</i> are illusions. Do not let them
deceive you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These words he spoke, while with a gentle mesmeric
touch he smoothed her hair and her brow, and held her
head close to his bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had neither the power nor the will to leave her resting-place; but her wild weeping softened into low sobs,
that became fewer and farther between, until at last they
ceased entirely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander looked down and saw that she was fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like a baby she had cried herself to sleep on his sheltering
bosom. She was no longer pale; her long-curved eye-lashes,
gemmed with tears, lay on her flushed cheeks, and
her slightly crimson lips showed the little pearly teeth
within; her dark brown disordered hair fell around a forehead
and down a neck as white as ivory.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Even in that solemn hour, Alexander, looking down upon
her, loved her for her wondrous beauty, seen in its new
phase of sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he had grace to know that such feelings were sacrilege
against this pure maiden and sacred orphan; and so he
gently arose and crossed the room to a large sofa and laid
her on it. And then he touched the bell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dorset answered it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Send one of the women servants here,” said Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man bowed and went away, and was succeeded by a
fat, motherly, middle-aged person who answered to the
name of Molly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander silently pointed to the form on the sofa.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! Lors-a-messy! poor gall! So she’s gone to sleep
at last. Well, sir, that will be the first sleep she’s had
since Sunday night, and this is Wednesday. Night and
day has she watched by the corpse and nobody to hinder
her,” said the fat woman, holding her sides and panting, as
she gazed on the sleeping orphan.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>You</i> should have hindered her,” said Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Me! Lors-a-messy! I couldn’t ha’ done it except by
main force, which I had no right to use.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well; let that pass. What I wish to know now is,
whether she can be undressed and put to bed comfortably
without being waked up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lors-a-messy, yes, sir! When they’s been watching
and weeping three days and nights and then draps down
and falls asleep, they might’s well be in a trance, far’s waking
up goes. Bless you, sir, you could hardly wake her up
if you was to fire off a pistol over her head.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad to hear you say so, but I have no wish to try
the experiment. I will carry her up stairs myself. Do
you go before and open the doors,” said Alexander, tenderly
raising the sleeping girl in his arms and carrying her, preceded
by Molly, up two flights of stairs, to Drusilla’s own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>little room. Here he laid her on the bed, and leaving her
to the care of the woman, retired.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went to the dinner that had been hastily prepared
for him. And when he had got through with it he went
into the late justice’s study and called up Dorset to a consultation
about the funeral.</p>

<p class='c011'>In answer to his master’s question, Dorset said that the
late housekeeper was laid out in her own room; that orders
had already been given for a plain, respectable funeral,
which was fixed for the next day. And Dorset hoped that
Mr. Lyon approved of what he had done.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite so. You have saved me so much trouble, that I
almost think my presence here might have been dispensed
with,” said Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, sir, I only wrote to you to ask what
should be done with Miss Drusilla, seeing that this would
no longer be a proper home for her,” said the old man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“True; I must think about that after the funeral. Of
course she can’t leave the house while her mother’s corpse
remains in it,” said Alexander, musingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he mused so long that he forgot the presence of
Dorset, until he happened to look up and see the old man
still standing respectfully waiting orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!—you may go now,” he then said.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the old servant bowed and retired.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day at noon the funeral took place. The
clergyman’s widow was carried to her grave in the cemetery
attached to the church to which she belonged.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, the sole mourner, rode in a coach with Alexander.
Her head, heavy with sorrow, rested on his shoulder,
and his arm encircled her waist. She never thought
whether this was right or wrong. She was borne down
with grief, and she leaned upon him who was her only
earthly support and comfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had never even thought of putting herself into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“decent mourning” for her lost mother. She was still
wearing black for old Mrs. Lyon, and so she really needed
no new outfit, except the black crape bonnet and heavy
crape veil; and these the forethought of the women servants
had provided her with.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander sustained his “child” through all the last
trying scene by the open grave. And when it was closed
he took her home.</p>

<p class='c011'>On entering the house he gave her into the charge of the
motherly Molly, with orders that she, Drusilla, should take
a cup of tea, and go to her room and lie down for the rest
of the day. This was Thursday.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Friday Alexander wrote to his cousin, giving an
account of the housekeeper’s death and burial, and saying
that henceforth he intended to adopt Drusilla, and that he
should take her back to school on the following Monday.</p>

<p class='c011'>Could Alexander have foreseen the bitter mortification he
was destined to meet there he would as soon have plunged
into a fire as entered that school-house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, grieving incessantly, kept her room until Sunday,
when she came down to breakfast for the first time
since the funeral.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander received her as if she had indeed been his
daughter or his beloved younger sister. He kissed her and
placed her in her seat. In the course of the meal he told
her that on the next day he should take her back to the
Irving Institute to resume and continue her studies until
she should graduate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla tried to express her acquiescence in the plan,
and her thanks for his kindness, but her voice faltered, and
her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked wistfully in her face and read her thoughts,
and answered them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You weep at the idea of being sent away from——”
He hesitated, and then continued: “from all you have left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>to love at a time when you want so much consolation. My
dear child it is necessary for more reasons than one. But I
shall spend the winter here as usual, Drusilla, and I will go
to see you at the school at least twice a week.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know that you are very good and all that you do is
perfectly right. I do not question these. But I must
weep a little, and I feel you will have patience with your
child,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My child never tries my patience,” said Alexander,
tenderly.</p>

<p class='c011'>They arose from the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander was rather a negligent Christian, but on this
day he attended Drusilla to church.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Monday morning he ordered the carriage, and took
her to school.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they arrived they were shown as usual into the
visitors’ parlor, where they waited while the parlor-maid
took Mr. Lyon’s card up to the principal.</p>

<p class='c011'>A longer interval than usual on such occasions passed
before the door swung open, and the stately Mrs. Irving
entered. She bowed to Mr. Lyon, and started slightly
on seeing Drusilla, and betrayed as much surprise and
annoyance as it was possible for so cultivated and self-possessed
a lady to exhibit. She sat down, however, and
waited for her visitor to open his business.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have brought your pupil back to you, Madam,” said
Mr. Lyon, bowing and waving his hand towards Drusilla,
who immediately arose and curtsied to her former schoolmistress,
and then resumed her seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” said the lady, very coldly, “I regret to say that
it is not convenient for us to receive Miss Sterling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander looked surprised, not so much at the words as
at the coldness with which they were uttered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sorry to hear you say so, Madam. Your house is
full then, I presume.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>The lady hesitated for a moment, and then seeing that
Mr. Lyon was looking at her and waiting for an answer,
she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, it is not full.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander was more surprised than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, Madam, may I ask why—but I beg your pardon;
you have certainly the right under any circumstances to
decline a pupil. I would be glad to know, however,
whether Miss Sterling’s tuition fees were in arrears at the
time she was temporarily withdrawn, or if they are so
now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir; Mrs. Lyon settled the account.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then why—Again I beg pardon; I have no right, perhaps,
to ask your reason for declining to receive my ward.
But I will venture to say that if there was any misunderstanding
as to the cause of her withdrawal twelve months
ago, I am happy to assure you that it was from no dissatisfaction
with the school or its teachers, or its discipline; and,
in short, that no offence was meant, and I hope none was
taken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“None, I assure you sir; for we all quite understood that
Miss Sterling was taken from school to attend upon her
guardian, Mrs. Lyon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander’s surprise grew into amazement. If the
school was not full, if the school-bills were punctually paid,
if no offence had been given or taken, why in the name
of wonder should the school mistress decline to receive
back into her charge a profitable pupil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam,” he said, rising to go, “I cannot demand an
explanation of your refusal to receive my ward—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I would rather not give one, sir,” interrupted the
lady, forgetting in her haste that it was not courteous to cut
short a gentleman’s words, and that she herself would have
rebuked any pupil of her school for doing such a thing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was about to say, Madam, that I could not demand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>such an explanation as a right, but that I would ask it as a
favor. I will take Miss Sterling back to the carriage and
return here immediately if you will be so kind as to await
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, sir—” commenced the lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander only bowed low in response, took the hand of
Drusilla and drew it under his arm and led her from the
room and the house, and placed her in the carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>He told the coachman to stop there, and then he went
back to the parlor, where he found the principal of the
school still waiting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam,” he commenced, gravely but courteously standing
before her, “there is something more in your refusal to
receive my ward than appears. I respectfully ask you to
tell me what it is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I entreat you, sir, as you are a gentleman, not to
press the question,” said Miss Irving very coldly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Believe me, Madam, if I only were concerned I would
press no unwelcome question upon any lady; but this is the
case of an orphan girl who, for no fault of hers, has received
a mortifying repulse. Forgive me if I still must press for
an explanation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sit down, sir, and if you must have it, I do not think
Drusilla Sterling a fit or proper associate for the young
ladies who are under my care.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam! Is it possible that in a democratic country
like this, the mere fact that a young girl happens to be the
daughter of a respectable housekeeper should exclude her
from the school where young ladies are educated? Consider;
her mother, though in some sort a domestic servant, was
still a most respectable person, the widow of a Baptist
preacher,” said Alexander, with ill suppressed vexation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, it is not the girl’s position, but her character, that
is so objectionable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Madam!</span>” exclaimed Alexander, firing up.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“You have, by forcing me to an explanation, sir, brought
all this unpleasantness upon yourself. I would willingly
have spared my own feelings and yours by keeping silent,”
said the lady, very gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, you have now said too much not to say more.
Who is it that dares to question the blameless character of
my young ward?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Common rumor, sir!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Common rumor!” exclaimed the young man, starting
up. Then controlling his excited passion, and re-seating
himself, he inquired grimly—“What is the nature of this
injurious rumor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her name is associated with yours in a manner that
must be fatal to the reputation of any young girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander stared blankly at the lady for a moment, and
then exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven and earth, Madam, what is it that you mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, it is not courteous to cross-question me in this manner,”
said Mrs. Irving, blushing between embarrassment
and anger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not courteous! Am I to be on courteous terms with
one who is stabbing.—Madam, if you were not a woman—But
let that pass. I now <i>insist</i> upon knowing what you
mean by saying that Drusilla Sterling’s spotless name
is associated with mine in a manner that must be fatal
to her,” indignantly exclaimed Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is said, then, that you are her favored lover,
with no intention of becoming her husband,” coldly and
curtly answered the lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven of Heavens!” exclaimed the young man,
starting up and striding across the room in his excitement,
“was ever such an infamous calumny!—Your
author, Madam! I demand to know your author!” he
at length said, standing before her, pale with fury.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I said common rumor,” quietly replied Mrs. Irving.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“No, but that will not do! Common rumor is an irresponsible
thing. I must have your author—one who can
be called to account, and made to swallow the calumny,
though it should choke the calumniator.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, sir, I fear you will have to call my whole school,
with its patrons behind it, to account. For this rumor
came in with the pupils who returned to the school after
the Christmas holidays. They heard it at their homes, or
in the social circles of the city where it was spoken of. Of
course, when this report came to the knowledge of the
teachers, they severely rebuked their pupils for such sort
of conversation. I know nothing of the truth or falsehood
of this report; it is quite enough that such exists to banish
its subject, guilty or innocent, from young ladies’ society.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander resumed his hurried walk to and fro in the
room in much distress of mind. Then, pausing once more
before the lady, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, I am wounded to the quick by these cruel and
fatal slanders. But would it not have been more womanly,
more Christian in you to have defended the good name of
that innocent girl and friendless orphan?—Friendless, but
for my friendship, which seems to have been her bane.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, you must please to remember that my position as
the principal of a young ladies’ academy is a peculiar one.
Had I even known your ward to be blameless, I could not,
in the face of such reports, have received her without
breaking up my school. Every pupil would have been removed
by her friends, nor could I have blamed them. I
regret to have pained you; but please also to remember
that you brought this pain upon yourself by insisting on
an explanation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I was right! And I will drag the foul slander
farther into the light. <i>Some</i> one originated it, and I will
make it my first business to discover and punish the originator.
Good morning, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>And with a very ceremonious bow Alexander Lyon left
the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he entered the carriage, and seated himself by
Drusilla’s side, she turned to him with a sweet, bright confiding
look, that smote him to the heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, do not smile on me so, my child! I have been too
thoughtless of your good. But you shall have justice—full
justice—grand justice! By the heavens above, you shall,
cost it what it may!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked at him now in much distress, and faltered
forth the question:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you tell me what has so disturbed you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He reflected for a moment, and then answered firmly,
though kindly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>No</i>, Drusilla—not for the world. To tell you would be
to wrong you. Trust in me, my child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I do, I do, as I trust in heaven!” she answered,
fervently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I will never betray that innocent trust, and may
the Lord deal with me as I shall deal with you, my child!”
he said, reverently lifting his hat.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the meantime the carriage, bowling along at a rapid
rate, brought them back to the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have forborne to ask me what passed in my interview
with the school mistress, (Satan fly away with her!”
he muttered between his teeth,) “and you have done well.
If the conversation had been proper for you to hear, I
should have repeated it to you,” said Alexander, as they
entered the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I trust in you,” Drusilla replied, as she bowed her
head, and then went up stairs to take off her bonnet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander Lyon went into the morning sitting-room and
rang the bell, and then dropped, half dead with trouble,
into his leathern arm-chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Dorset answered the summons.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“Come here—close to me,” said the young man.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Dorset; perplexed and disturbed by the looks and
manners of his master, approached.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dorset, you are an old, faithful and very discreet servant,”
commenced Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dorset bowed humbly and silently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish to speak to you upon a very delicate subject,
which I would not name to any other person in the house,
or even to you, except under the most urgent necessity.
Dorset——” He paused, as if he found the greatest difficulty
in proceeding. And Dorset bowed again, and waited
in respectful attention. “Dorset,” he resumed, “while
Miss Sterling has been in this house, have you heard any
rumor prejudicial to her good name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old servant bowed his head upon his breast, and remained
in a deep silence of grief and mortification.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is enough!” said the young man, grimly; “your
silence is more eloquent than words. But now open your
mouth and speak, to tell me who started these reports, for,
by the father of lies, I swear to visit them heavily upon
the head of the slanderer!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old servant shook his gray locks slowly and sadly,
and then answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, my dear master! in that case, I fear, you would
have to punish the dead, and I scarcely believe that you
would do that if you could, or could do it if you would.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean, old man?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, sir, you might almost guess. The report started
with that poor, mad woman’s fancies about you having
married her daughter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander sprang from his chair, struck his forehead, and
then sinking into his seat again, murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I might have foreseen this; I ought to have foreseen it
when I humored and almost encouraged the poor creature
in her illusions. But how did this get out?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“Well, sir, it was in this way: her church friends came
to see her, and she babbled to them about your fancied
marriage with her daughter, which, of course, none of
them believed. If you remember, sir, in speaking of the
poor woman’s death, I told you she died easy and not too
soon, for that she had grown more and more foolish every
day. It seemed heartless to say so, sir, but indeed it was
true; for from babbling of your marriage with her daughter,
she got to babbling about your wronging of her daughter,
in the very worst way a gentleman could wrong a young
woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good heavens! was ever such a fatal calamity?” cried
Alexander, starting up and pacing the room in great excitement.
“Oh, my child! my child! my lamb! my dove!
my dear, dear Drusilla! Go on, old man! go on! what
next?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, they to whom she babbled believed this last lie,
and took it into their addled heads that the mother’s madness
was caused by the daughter’s ruin, and went and reported
as they believed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Who</i> were they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Women, sir, more the pity! women of the church—old
women who came to take tea and talk scandal with the
housekeeper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And did Drusilla—did my poor child hear all this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think not, sir. Mad as the mother was, she had
sense enough left to send her daughter out of the room
whenever she was about to babble. No, sir; I feel sure
Miss Drusilla knows nothing about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank heaven for that! She shall never know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“These reports, sir, caused me, in writing to you of the
housekeeper’s death, to ask you what should be done with
Miss Drusilla; for I knew that this house was no longer a
proper home for her, as I took the liberty of hinting to you,
sir; for though Molly and myself and indeed all the servants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>did all we could to put a stop to these rumors, we could
not succeed in doing it. And so, sir,” repeated the old
man, “I made so bold as to ask you what should be done
with Miss Drusilla.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know <span class='fss'>NOW</span> what shall be done with her. <span class='sc'>She shall
be married!</span>” said Alexander Lyon, grimly. “And now,
Dorset, you may go; and remember, not one word of this
interview to any living creature!” he added.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely not, sir,” said the old man, bowing himself out
of the room, and much wondering, if Miss Drusilla was to
be married, where Mr. Lyon meant to find her a husband.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='large'>JOY FOR DRUSILLA.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Joy trickled in her tears, joy filled the sob</div>
      <div class='line'>That rocked her heart till almost heard to throb;</div>
      <div class='line'>And paradise was breathing in the sigh</div>
      <div class='line'>Of nature’s child, in nature’s ecstacy.—<span class='sc'>Byron.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>While Alexander Lyon paced the floor of his study,
trembling with shame and anger, Drusilla sat in her little
chamber, smiling with delight. The same event that
thrilled his soul with a sense of wrong and mortification,
filled her heart with joy. She was not to go back to school.
She was to stay home with him; and this was all sufficient
to her happiness. She neither knew, nor guessed, nor cared
why she had been declined, as a pupil by Mrs. Irving. She
had a vague impression that the school was full, or the
staff of teachers incomplete; but she was too entirely
absorbed in the happy thought of being at home for good
with him, to speculate about the reason why she was so.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the last twelve months, while in attendance upon
her late benefactress, and also while with her lost mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Drusilla had had the entire charge of Alexander’s wardrobe.
To keep it in perfect order was with her a labor of love.
So, on this morning, when she was so unexpectedly and joyfully
reprieved from banishment, she sat down with her
little work-basket beside her, and occupied the hours in
darning small holes in silk and lambs-wool socks; and so
neatly she darned, that it would have required sharp eyes
to have found out where the recent rents had been. She
worked and sang at her work, for her heart was overflowing
with happiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! even her mother was for the moment forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'>Late in the afternoon she was sent for to join Mr. Lyon
at dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>She merely smoothed her hair and put on a fresh collar
and pair of cuffs, and then went down into the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>There had always been kindness and gentleness in his
manner to her. But now, as he arose to meet her, there
was a tenderness in his expression that she had never seen
before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My poor child! You are smiling; I really believe you
are glad to be back at home,” he said, as he placed her in
her chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed I am, very glad,” answered Drusilla, truthfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then—so am I,” said Alexander, smiling on her;
and then adding, in a lower tone—“It is fate; who can
resist it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He helped her to the most delicate morsels, from each
dish. And to please him she tried to eat a little; but, in
truth, joy as surely takes appetite away as grief does; and
added to her joy in being at home was a strange, vague presentiment
of something about to happen, something imminent
and momentous. All the spiritual atmosphere around
her seemed as full of this, as the air before a storm is full
of electricity.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Alexander ate no more than she did. And neither
spoke often or much.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, when they had lingered some time over the
dessert, he arose and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My child, are you too shy to withdraw, and are you
waiting for me to dismiss you? Go, then, into the
drawing-room, and presently I will come to you there,
and you shall give me a cup of tea,” and so saying he
opened the door, and held it open for her to pass out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Alexander—you <i>are</i> glad I am not going back to
school, are you not?” she inquired, doubtfully and anxiously,
as she paused in the doorway and raised her beautiful
beseeching eyes to his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes! by all my hopes of happiness, I am glad!” he
suddenly exclaimed; and then he added—(“I am always
glad to have my fate decided for me,”) and then again laughing
lightly, he said—“There, go away, little love! I will
join you presently.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla went to the drawing-room; but she did not sit
down; she walked slowly up and down the room, strangely
perturbed by that presentiment, of which she could not yet
know whether it was to be one of joy or great woe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander remained in the dining-room alone; not drinking
wine, or smoking cigars; neither of these small vices
affected him. He was simply trying to commune with
himself; a difficult task to one so unused to self-examination
as Mr. Lyon. He had always loved his beautiful pet, more
than he had ever loved any other living creature; and always,
as he supposed, in a fatherly, or elder brotherly sort of
fashion. But lately this pure love had burst forth into a
fierce passion. From the hour in which he had soothed her
sorrow, and hushed her to rest on his bosom, and gazed on
her sleeping beauty, he had longed to make that beauty his
own forever. True, from the very first, he had combatted
this passion. From the very moment that he found himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>contemplating the beautiful girl with other feelings than
became the brotherly love he professed for her, he put her
from his arms, and tried to put her from his heart, and made
arrangements for placing her entirely out of his sight and
out of his way, in the safe refuge of her school. How and
why she was rejected by the principal of that school, the
reader already knows.</p>

<p class='c011'>The very fact of rejection threw her back upon his hands,
while the cause of it appealed to his manhood in her
behalf.</p>

<p class='c011'>When sinners can find no other excuse for sin, they plead
fate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander, sitting and gazing dreamily into the lights
and shadows of his glowing coal fire, said to himself that
fate had set itself against his union with Anna, and fate had
thrown Drusilla into his arms. He recalled the facts that
his wedding with Anna, twice fixed, had been twice stopped
by the hand of death; that Anna did not love him, and did
love Richard Hammond: that he himself did not love Anna,
but loved Drusilla; that Drusilla loved him, and had most
innocently suffered reproach and injury on his account;
that he had striven to overcome his passion for the beautiful
orphan, even to the extent of taking her to school with
the full intention of leaving her there, but that she had
been repulsed and thrown back upon his charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had decided that in all this was the irresistible hand of
fate. This and many other arguments he used to persuade
himself that it would be altogether right for him to give up
his cousin Anna, and take to his bosom the beautiful orphan
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this would have been right, if he had only chosen to
do it in the right way. If he had written to his betrothed
and told <i>her</i> all that he told <i>himself</i>, there is no doubt that
she would have gladly released him from his engagement;
and then if he had asked Drusilla to be his wife, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>married her in the face of all the world, his course would
have been upright and honorable. But he did none of
these things. Alexander Lyon was proud, and he wished
to satisfy his love, without sacrificing his pride, so he resolved
that his marriage with the late housekeeper’s daughter,
should be a strictly secret one.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having made up his mind, he arose and walked into the
drawing-room, where he found Drusilla still slowly pacing
up and down the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you restless little creature! One would think
your thoughts had been as perturbed as my own. Come,
now! tell me truly, what you are dreaming of,” said
Alexander, possessing himself of her hand, and drawing
her down by his side on the sofa.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something in his look and manner, something that she
had never seen there before, startled and almost terrified
her. For the first time, in all their association, a swift, hot
blush swept over her face and neck, crimsoning both, so
that Alexander, already half mad with love, thought her
more beautiful and bewitching than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come now! of what were you thinking?” he persisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, I do not know; I have forgotten;—of nothing,
I believe; I was not thinking; I was—trembling,” faltered
the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trembling, my darling? Why should you tremble?
No evil shall come near you while I live,” said Alexander,
tenderly. “Come, tell me why you were trembling?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was—but you will laugh at me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, indeed, my sweet——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was with a sort of presentiment that oppressed me,”
said Drusilla, in a tone deepened with awe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A humming-bird is said to tremble before an approaching
storm, though no cloud be in the sky. You are as sensitive
as a humming-bird, my pet; do you tremble at an
approaching storm?” smiled Alexander, gently caressing
her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>For the first time in her life, she shrank from him, yet
immediately wondered at and reproached herself for doing
so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, my love, is it a good or evil presentiment that
overawes you so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know even <i>that</i> much. I have felt all the
evening as if something was hanging over me—I cannot
tell what. Yes, the air is full of electricity,” she said, and
stopped and shuddered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My child, superstitious people say that dreams and presentiments
go by contraries. If you dream of a death, it
is a sign of a wedding; if you have a foreboding of evil, it
is a sign some good is about to happen to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I do not know whether <i>my</i> foreboding is of good
or evil,” she said, softly smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you, then, my darling. It is of <i>both</i>, since
it foreshadows love and marriage, Drusilla,” he answered,
gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>She started slightly, shrank a little, and raised her eyes
timidly to his face, but dropped them instantly, and blushed
beneath the ardent gaze with which he was regarding her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla,” he said, panting and speaking low, “do you
know how I love you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Had he asked her this question a week before, speaking
in his usual tone, she would have answered him promptly
and sweetly and calmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>But now she only trembled very much, without being
able to utter a word.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know how I love you, Drusilla?” he panted
low, stealing his arm around her waist.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t, sir! please don’t!” gasped the girl, frightened
at his caress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t what, my darling?” he whispered, drawing her
closer to his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t! let me go, please!” she faltered, gently
trying to free herself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“‘Don’t let you go, please!’ I don’t intend to, my
beautiful darling,” said Alexander, passionately pressing
his lips to hers.</p>

<p class='c011'>At that moment the door was pushed gently open by
Dorset, who entered with the tea tray, and stood still in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What the—?—What do you want here?” angrily
demanded Alexander barely able to repress an oath, as he
saw Dorset and hastily released Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, sir, it is the tea tray,” said the old man,
in growing wonder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hang the tea tray! What do you mean by bringing it
here before it is wanted?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beg pardon, sir, but it is nine o’clock, when I allers
brings it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then why don’t you knock before entering a room?
You servants are perfect vandals in your rudeness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please, sir, I never was used to knock in the old
Madam’s time, so I did not know as I was expected to do it
now; but beg pardon, sir, I will allers knock for the
future.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Put the tray down and go.—No, stay and wait,”
growled Alexander, beginning to feel conscious that if his
kiss was an indiscretion, his fuss with the old man’s interruption
of it was a still greater one.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dorset obediently sat the tray down on the table,
arranged the tea service, bowed, and stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, my little daughter, you must preside,” said
Alexander, trying to give a paternal aspect to his affection
for the orphan.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, blushing deeply, took her place at the table and
poured out the tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander purposely kept his old servant in waiting until
they had finished. Then he bid Dorset remove the service.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as he found himself alone with Drusilla, he saw
that the girl was trembling excessively.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“Don’t be alarmed, dear love, and don’t distrust me,” he
said, drawing his chair beside her. “I asked you just now
if you knew how I loved you. You did not reply, but I
will answer the question for you. No, Drusilla, you don’t
know how I love, for I love you so much that I wish to
make you my own forever and ever. Drusilla, you must be
my wife, never to be parted from me again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked up in his face, her arched brows, dilated eyes
and parted lips expressing amazement, delight, and even
terror.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will be my wife, Drusilla?” he whispered, drawing
her towards him.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then her overwrought heart found relief in tears,
and she wept freely on his bosom. When at length she
ceased to sob, and grew quiet, he bent his head down to
hers and whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“All this means ‘yes,’ does it not, my own?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—but—Miss Anna!” murmured the girl, scarcely
trusting her voice to speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Anna——” He nearly uttered an oath consigning
his cousin to perdition, but he caught himself in
time, and added: “Miss Anna and myself are parted (by a
hundred miles of space,”) was his mental reservation the
first.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has broken with you, then?” said Drusilla, who
never dreamed of such a possibility as <i>his</i> breaking faith
with any one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, she has, (in effect,”) was his mental reservation
the second.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how could—how could she do it?” inquired
Drusilla, incredulously; for to her fond, worshipping heart,
it seemed that any woman who could break faith with
Alexander must be insane or lost.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She loves Richard Hammond’s little finger more than
she does my immortal soul! (Come that is wholly true, at
all events,”) he added mentally.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“And you are grieved at this?” murmured the girl,
mournfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I! I grieved at it? I never was so glad of anything in
my life! My child, I never loved Anna except as a cousin.
She never loved me in any other than a cousinly way. We
were betrothed by our parents—a sure process to prevent
our ever falling in love with each other. Ours was to be
‘a union of hands and a union of lands,’ but not ‘a union
of hearts.’ We really never wished to marry each other.
She loved Richard as well as she can love anybody, and I—I
love you as I never loved any other. Come, my
darling, you are to be mine forever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But Mr. Alexander—a poor girl like myself—your late
housekeeper’s child—only half educated, too—I am not fit
to be your wife,” she said, raising her meek eyes to his face,
and then suddenly dropping them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not fit to be my wife! If you are not, it is only because
you are so much too good for me!” vehemently exclaimed
Drusilla’s lover, and he spoke the truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh no! Oh no! please do not say such things to me.
I am but a poor, ignorant child, of very humble position.
You are a gentleman of rank and wealth. Indeed, sir, it
is not suitable——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla! You do not love me!” he exclaimed, as if
he had been charging her with a great sin.</p>

<p class='c011'>A year before, she would have thrown her arms around
his neck, and amid tears and caresses, she would have
assured him that she loved him more than all others on
earth. But she could make no such protestations now,
though her love for him had in this year grown and strengthened,
until it absorbed her whole being. She could only
raise a quick and quickly withdrawn deprecating glance to
his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, that means that you do love me a little. If so,
let me be the judge of your fitness to be my wife,” he
said, looking tenderly down on her bowed face.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“I know you must be the best judge,” she meekly
admitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, it is a settled thing. You are to be my own,” he
whispered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you think that a poor girl like myself can comfort
you for the loss of Miss Anna—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bosh! I beg your pardon, little love. But I don’t need
comfort for the loss of Miss Anna. I require congratulations
rather. Didn’t I tell you that I never was so glad of
anything in my life? And didn’t I give you half a dozen
reasons of being glad of it? I want you to be my love
and joy. Come, darling, will you be my wife? Try to
answer—”</p>

<p class='c011'>She stooped and whispered—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will be anything you wish me to. If you should tell
me to go and be a nun, I would go and be one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was not more than half pleased with this answer,
which he did not understand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you only consent to marry me because I ask you to
do it; and not because you love me, or because to do so
would make you happy?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again her shy, soft eyes were lifted to his face with a
pleading glance and then cast down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Answer me, Drusa,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would make me happy to do anything you should ask
me to do; for I love to feel that I belong to you, to do your
bidding; and that you have a right to dispose of me as
you please,” she murmured, in a very low and timid
tone, hesitating and blushing to utter her own pure
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is devotion, this is submission, but it may not be
the love that makes happiness. Drusilla, apart from all
this—your pleasure in pleasing me. Will it make you in
yourself happy to be my wife and spend your whole life by
my side?” he earnestly inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“As happy as an angel in Heaven,” she aspirated, in a
low and fervent tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>He caught her closer to his bosom and pressed her
there; he pressed kisses on her lips, her cheeks, her brow;
he called her by every endearing name——</p>

<p class='c011'>There came a gentle, discreet knock at the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! Who’s there? Come in!” said Mr. Alexander
impatiently, as he gently put Drusilla off his knee.</p>

<p class='c011'>The door opened and Dorset appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What now? I really believe you are wantonly trying
my temper!” exclaimed Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, sir, I thought maybe you had retired,
and I came to rake out the fire and turn off the gas, as
usual, before going to bed myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What! at <i>this</i> hour?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beg pardon, sir, but this is the usual hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander looked up at the clock on the mantle-piece,
and saw with surprise, that it was past eleven.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My little daughter, I have kept you up too late. You
must go to rest now. Good night,” he said, taking a bedroom
candle from the side table, lighting it, and putting it
in the hands of Drusilla, who immediately withdrew.</p>

<p class='c011'>She went to her room in a delirium of joy, every nerve
thrilling, heart beating, brain whirling with joy. To be
Alexander’s wife! It was a Heaven of Heavens she had
never dreamed of. She dropped on her knees beside her
bed, and fervently thanked God for her great happiness.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How beautiful she looked, her conscious heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Glowed in her cheek and yet she felt no wrong.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, love, how perfect thy majestic art,</div>
      <div class='line'>Strengthening the weak and trampling on the strong!</div>
      <div class='line'>How self-deceitful is the sages’ part</div>
      <div class='line'>Of mortals whom thy art hath led along.—<span class='sc'>Byron.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I said that joy takes away the appetite as surely as
grief does; and joy as well as grief banishes repose. Drusilla
lay awake, in a happy reverie, until near morning,
when she fell into fitful slumbers that soon deepened into
dreamless sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was late in the forenoon when she awoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! how many of us have awakened from such deep
insensibility to the consciousness of some heavy but undefined
and half-forgotten woe, that all too soon takes shape
and distinctness to confront and overwhelm us!</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, on the contrary, awoke in the golden mist of
some great but vague joy, that soon shaped itself into the
thought that she was to be the wife of one she loved more
than her own soul, and only less than her God.</p>

<p class='c011'>But such exultation of the spirit seldom lasts long.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the girl had finished her simple morning toilet,
her joy was sunk in remorseful tenderness that she could
rejoice in anything so soon after her poor mother’s death.
And she wept; but though less exultant, she was scarcely
less happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>She went down into the morning sitting-room. Alexander
had waited for her, because he would not breakfast
without her. He met her with a radiant smile, and he
welcomed her with a warm embrace.</p>

<p class='c011'>After breakfast, he spoke to her of his plans for the
future. He told her that he wished their marriage to take
place almost immediately.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>She timidly expressed her feelings on this subject; the
equal pain she would feel in opposing his wishes on the one
hand, or, in marrying so soon after her mother’s death on
the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why should you feel pain at the thought of marrying
so soon after your poor mother’s death, my darling?”
tenderly inquired her lover.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would seem heartless; it would seem disrespectful to
her memory?” said the orphan.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all, my love. Daughters are sometimes, when
expedient, married even beside the death-beds of their
mothers. You have heard or read of such cases?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then why should you feel any scruple in marrying, if
expedient, within a few weeks after your dear mother’s
decease?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But <i>is</i> it expedient?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is more. It is absolutely necessary. We must
immediately marry, or——<span class='fss'>PART</span>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This last word struck her like a shot, as he intended that
it should. She started, drew back, and gazed at him in
consternation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, my innocent, ignorant child, does it not occur
to you that it would be wrong for you, a young girl, and I,
a young man, to live alone together, or with only servants
in the house, unless we were married?” he gravely
inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>She flushed crimson over face and neck, but had no word
to reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, we must be married immediately,” he said,
firmly, striking “while the iron was hot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—so soon after my poor mother’s death. To be
made so happy, when I ought to be weeping for her,” faltered
the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My darling, you shall weep for a year if you like, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>that you weep in my arms, and give me a legal right to
hold you there. Come, Drusilla! If our wedding were
going to be a gay one, with fine dresses, and fine company
and festivities, you might, indeed, object that it would be
showing disrespect to your mother’s memory. But I propose
that our wedding shall be a very very quiet one, as
quiet as if it were solemnized at a death-bed. Come, what
do you say to that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Alexander, I know you would not lead me into the
least departure from the duty I owe to the memory of my
dear, lost mother. Decide for me, Mr. Alexander,” she
said very sweetly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I will. But leave out the ‘Mr.,’ my darling. I
do not like the formality of that word from your sweet
lips. Shall I decide for you in <i>all</i> things, my pet?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In all things, yes. Whom have I in the world but
you?” she said, lifting her dove-like eyes confidingly to
his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No one indeed—thank heaven!” exclaimed Alexander,
with triumph in the thought of how entirely this delicate,
helpless, dependent child lay in his power and at his mercy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The thought should have awakened his magnanimity;
but, unhappily, it only flattered his selfishness.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did decide all things for her. He decided that their
marriage should be a strictly secret one; and he gave her
plausible reasons why it must be so; but she needed for
this, no other reason than his will. He decided that the
house in Richmond was too gloomy in its associations of
insanity, illness, and death, for their habitation, and that
they should go to Washington to spend the winter. And
he arranged that he himself should go in advance to the
capital city and secure a home; and that on the receipt of a
certain letter which he should write, she should secretly
leave the house and join him in Washington.</p>

<p class='c011'>To all this Drusilla readily agreed. In the fulness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>her faith she had placed her fate in his hands and left it
there.</p>

<p class='c011'>This plan was carried out. The same day he told his
old servant that urgent business called him away from
home, and that he should leave for Baltimore the next
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dorset, prompt and punctual, had his master’s portmanteau
packed and his breakfast on the table by eight o’clock.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mr. Alexander left Richmond by the nine o’clock
train for Baltimore, intending to take the next day’s
train from the latter city to Washington.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla knew that she could not hear from him for three
or four days, so she waited three days and then went to the
post-office, where, for greater secrecy, her letters were to be
left until called for. Here she found a letter—the first
genuine love letter she had ever received. She had, from
childhood, written many letters to Alexander, and received
many from him—all, his and hers, filled with love, but not
such love as this. Drusilla eagerly read it over in the office,
and then, “all on fire with joy,” she hurried home and
locked herself in her own room, to feast on her letter undisturbed
and at leisure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every day she went to the post-office, and every day she
received one of these ardent outpourings of love.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander had been absent about ten days, when one
morning on inquiry, she received a letter that summoned
her at once to Washington.</p>

<p class='c011'>That night Drusilla quietly packed her carpet bag with a
few necessaries, and before day the next morning she
slipped out of the house and took the early train for Washington.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train reached Alexandria early in the afternoon, and
Drusilla found her lover on the platform at the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, dear love,” he said, “I have a carriage waiting.
We must be married in this town, and then I will take you
to Washington.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>In a flutter of delight and embarrassment she let him
take her from the train and place her in the carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>He told the coachman to drive to Duke street, and as
soon as the carriage was in motion, he caught his bride in
his arms and pressed her to his bosom, amid the fondest
caresses and tenderest words of endearment.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was interrupted at length by the stopping of the
coach, and the voice of the coachman inquiring:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where in Duke Street am I to drive, if you please,
sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the Reverend Mr. Hopper’s—the new Methodist
preacher’s,” replied Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>And a few more turns of the wheels brought the carriage
to the house indicated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander lifted his trembling companion to the sidewalk,
and then led her up the steps to the door of Mr. Hopper’s
residence.</p>

<p class='c011'>A servant answered his knock, and showed him into a
plainly furnished parlor, where sat the preacher and the
family, dressed in their Sunday’s best, and apparently
waiting the bridal pair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hopper arose at once and shook hands with the bridegroom,
and presented him to his—the preacher’s—mother
and sisters.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander, in turn, presented his bride to the ladies of
the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as no time was to be lost, the young pair stood up
side by side; the ladies of the party arranged themselves
as attendants and witnesses, and the ceremony that made
Alexander Lyon and Drusilla Sterling man and wife was
performed.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the blessing had been pronounced, Alexander
saluted his “child-wife” with the almost reverential tenderness
due to her sacred isolation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The preacher shook hands with both and wished them
much joy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Then the ladies of the family came up with their congratulations.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old lady kissed the youthful bride with much feeling,
saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“May the Lord bless you, poor, motherless little thing!—And
you, sir,” she added, turning to the bridegroom—“Remember
that her extreme youth and her recent orphanage
claim a double amount of tenderness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it, madam; I feel it; and I thank you for the
interest you take in my little wife,” said Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>He then slipped a hundred dollar note in the preacher’s
hand, bowed his adieux to the whole party, and led his bride
back to the carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad the dear old lady gave us her blessing. It
seemed to hallow our union, as much as the ceremony did.
But I wonder how she knew I was an orphan?” said
Drusilla, as they crossed the sidewalk to the carriage door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told them as much of your circumstances as I deemed
expedient to account for your coming unattended by ladies,
and in a black dress,” said Alexander, as they paused while
the driver got down and opened the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In a black dress! So I was married in a black dress—a
black bombazine and crape dress, at that. The very
deepest sort of mourning!” exclaimed Drusilla, in a low
tone and with a terrified look.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, my darling, what of that?” smiled Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it is considered a bad omen for any one, though
but a guest, to wear a black dress, even a black silk one, to
a wedding. And for a bride to be married in black, especially
in deep mourning, is the worst of all omens.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Omens be—blessed! Are you so superstitious, little
one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! who is not? I never met any one in my life who
did not believe in this omen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ve lived so long in this world, you have! and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>you’ve met, so many people!” laughed the bridegroom, as
he put her into the carriage and seated himself beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where am I to drive to, sir, if you please?” inquired
the coachman, touching his hat, as he held the door open.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are your horses fresh?” demanded Mr. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite so, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can they take us to Washington? The distance by
the river-road is nine miles, I think.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bless you, yes, sir! why they can take you to Washington,
which is nine miles, and afterwards to Bladensburg,
which is nine more, with the greatest of ease.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right—drive to Washington.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The coachman closed the door, mounted to his box and
started.</p>

<p class='c011'>An hour’s drive along the beautiful wooded road, following
the south bank of the Potomac, brought the travellers
to the Long Bridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>They crossed the river by that bridge and entered the
city.</p>

<p class='c011'>The near view of Washington from that point is not encouraging.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander felt this as he bade his young companion look
beyond the flats of the “island” and behold the distant
and majestic hill upon the summit of which rises our
Capitol.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun declined towards his setting, shone full upon
the building’s western front, whose walls of white freestone
and windows of crystal glass flashed back the rays, “in lines
of dazzling light.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla uttered an exclamation of pleasure; but was interrupted
by the stopping of the carriage, and the appearance
of the coachman at the door, inquiring:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where now, if you please, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Seventh street north, and out by that road to the
suburbs of the city.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>The coachman re-mounted his box and started his horses
once more. They crossed the canal bridge near the centre-market,
and crossed Pennsylvania Avenue, and as they went
on, Alexander pointed out to his companion, all the objects
of interest within the range of their vision—a nearer view
of the Capitol, then the General Post-Office, the National
Patent Office, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>A half hour’s drive up Seventh street north, took them
beyond the limits of the city, and into the wild, picturesque
and beautiful suburbs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wilderness surroundings of our National Capitol
have often been admired by strangers who are lovers of
nature, and reproached by others who can see no beauty in
anything but miles of brick walls and busy shops, or acres
of ploughed fields and growing crops. We “to the manor
born,” love the wild woods and rocks and waterfalls so near,
as to be even within the limits of our city. A half hour’s
drive from the Capitol in any direction will take the traveller
into solitudes as deep as he can find anywhere west of
the Alleghanies.</p>

<p class='c011'>A half hour’s drive up Seventh street north took our
happy pair quite into what seemed a country road.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was bordered on the western side by evergreen woods,
through which the last rays of the setting sun were shining
and tipping every dark-hued leaf and twig with golden
fire; and on the north by groves and fields and streams,
with here and there a solitary, but cheerful cottage from
whose windows the “household fires gleamed warm and
bright.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently, Alexander pulled the check-string and ordered
the driver to turn into an obscure road or lane, leading into
the cedar wood on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have never asked me where I am taking you to,
my darling,” said Alexander, when they had gone about a
quarter of a mile into the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“No; because my trust in you is so perfect.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had you no curiosity?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes; but I thought you would tell me when you
should see fit; and I knew that I should find out when we
should reach the spot. I am very much pleased, however,
that our home will be in the country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not the country, darling, though it looks so much like
it; only the suburbs of the city.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is all the same to me, and I am so glad we are to live
among the trees.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew you would be, love, and so I chose our home in
this neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But shall you not be lonesome, so far from the city;
you, who are so fond of plays and concerts and operas?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, mine own. I shall be lonesome nowhere, with you
by my side. Besides, thirty minutes’ drive would take us
any evening to any place of amusement we might wish to
attend in the city. But here we are at home!” he said,
pulling the check-string and stopping the carriage at a rustic
gate that crossed the lane in the very midst of the wood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some one issued from a very small porter’s lodge on the
right and opened the gate. They entered upon a semicircular
drive, bordered on each side by cedar-trees, that led
them up to the front of a picturesque cottage ornée, built in
a sort of composite style.</p>

<p class='c011'>From every pretty latticed window of this little dwelling,
the lights of fires and of lamps gleamed warm welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what a lovely little wildwood home!” exclaimed
Drusilla in delight, as Alexander lifted her from the carriage
and seated her on a bench of the little rustic porch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Business before pleasure,’ my darling,” he said, leaving
her there, and going back to dismiss the carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was happy and therefore he was extravagant. He
never asked the coachman the price of his services, but put
in his hand a twenty dollar bank note, about twice the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>amount of his fare; and when the latter fumbled in his
pocket-book, said quickly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I don’t want any change! It is now about five
o’clock; you can easily get back to Alexandria by seven.
Good night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The coachman was profuse in his thanks, and hoped to
have the pleasure of driving his honor often. And he
mounted his box and drove off, no doubt wishing that he
could have a bridal party for a fare every day of his life.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the bridegroom led his bride into the house.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Welcome, mine own dear love, welcome to your home,”
fervently whispered Alexander, as he led his bride across
the threshold of the door that was held open by a pretty
and neatly-dressed negro girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young wife smiled gratefully upon her husband, and
then looked around with child-like interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>They stood in a cheerful little hall, illuminated by an
antique lamp in a stained glass shade, that shed myriads of
prismatic hues over the white and gilded wall and richly-carpeted
floor. It was a hexagon-shaped hall, with a staircase
opposite the front door, and with four other doors, two
on each side, opening into the drawing-room and dining-room
on the right, and the parlor and library on the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is your little maid, Pina, my dear, and she will
show you to your room, if you please,” said Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Drusilla turned and smiled kindly on the bright-eyed
negro girl, who took up a wax candle, and stood curtseying
and waiting orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go on then, Pina, and lead the way; I will follow,”
said Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Alexander placed the carpet bag that contained all
the bride’s trousseau in the hands of the girl, who, with
another curtsey, turned and led the way up stairs to an
upper hexagon-shaped hall, with a bay window in the front
end, and four doors, two on each side, leading into bedrooms
and dressing-rooms.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina opened the front door on the right hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what a sweet, what a pretty, what a delightful little
room!” exclaimed Drusilla, on passing the threshold.</p>

<p class='c011'>The room deserved her praise. It had been designed by
the hands of love to please the eyes of beauty. Its colors
were white and rose. The walls were hung with a paper of
a white ground, with a running vine of wild roses over it.
The floor was covered with a carpet white with the same
patterns of wild roses running over it. The windows were
curtained with white lace, lined with rose-colored silk. The
dressing-table that stood between the windows was draped
to match them, in white lace over rose silk. The bed was
spread with a white crochet counterpane, lined with rose
satin. The chairs and sofas were covered with white
damask embroidered in roses. All the little stands and
tables were in white and rose enamel.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a chamber to delight a child or a young girl. To
crown all, a clear, bright wood-fire was burning on the
white marble hearth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is—it is a heavenly little room!” exclaimed Drusilla
gazing around.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And here, ma’am, is the dressing place,” continued the
maid, opening an inner door, and showing her mistress into
a smaller apartment fitted up in a plainer style as a bathroom.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>The young traveller, who really needed ablutions after
her dusty ride in the train, opened her carpet bag, took out
her dressing materials, and commenced her toilet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina waited on her.</p>

<p class='c011'>But little change could the poor bride make. Her carpet
bag could not contain much. She had only brought a
few clean linen collars, cuffs, handkerchiefs, and other absolute
essentials.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seeing this, her handmaid said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me carry your dress down stairs and brush it,
ma’am: it won’t take me ten minutes. I will bring it up
quite nice by the time you are ready to put it on again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla thanked the little maid, and accepted the offer.
And Pina ran away with the dress. And by the time
Drusilla had taken her bath and dressed her hair the girl
returned with the renovated garment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Supper will be served, ma’am, as soon as you are ready
for it,” said Pina, laying the dress over the back of a chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla carefully but hastily completed her toilet, for she
was eager to see Alexander and thank him for the care and
taste he had bestowed upon the fitting up of her rooms.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she left her chamber she found Alexander in the
hexagon-shaped hall outside. He smiled, and took her arm,
saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“While they are placing supper on the table I wish to
show you over our little toy palace—for it is no more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And no less! Oh, how I thank you for the beautiful—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Doll’s house!” laughed Alexander, stopping his bride
in the outpouring of her gratitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but the rooms are so very beautiful!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you have seen but two! Come, let me show you
the others,” he said, taking her across the little hall, and
opening an opposite door.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>The apartment they now entered corresponded in all
respects to her chamber, except that it was fitted up as a
sewing-room, and its wall paper, window curtains, chair-covers,
carpet and enamelled stands and tables were all in
white and green instead of white and rose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See here, my love! I remember what a domestic little
creature you were, how you liked to sit up stairs and sew
by the hour or the day, and how the very first thing you
ever wished for was a work-box, and so I had this room fitted
up for you on purpose,” said Alexander, looking in her face
to read her satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how good, how good you are to me! What can I
ever do to please you enough,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Love me dearly, and be very happy! That is all I ask
you to do,” he replied. “And now look here, dear, I knew
your wardrobe would want complete refitting, and I knew
what a nice little needle-woman you were, so I have filled
these bureau drawers and wardrobes with dress goods of
every description—enough to furnish forth an Indian voyage
or a country shop,” he said, as he went to one of the
bureaus and drew out the drawers, one after another, to
display their contents—rich silk, merino, and cashmere dress
patterns, all in black, purple, or gray, or other mourning or
half mourning hues; and whole pieces of fine muslin, linen,
flannel, and other “staple” commodities, and rolls of ribbon,
tape, gimp, and other dress trimmings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know I had no woman’s help in selecting these
articles, and a man in a milliner’s establishment is just
about us much out of place as a ‘bull in a china shop,’
but I did the best I could.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are beautiful,” said Drusilla, in grateful delight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And see here,” continued Alexander, opening the doors
of a wardrobe—and displaying several shawls, cloaks, circulars,
mantillas and so forth—“as these things fit almost any
grown woman, I thought I could not make a mistake in
getting them ready-made. What do <i>you</i> think?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“Oh, you—you are too good to me; you are extravagant—here
are more than I shall wear in ten years,” said Drusilla,
between smiles and tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all! There’s Anna will wear twice as many
changes of apparel in ten days,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, but Miss Anna is an heiress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you are the wife of a—<i>wealthy</i> man, if not a <i>good</i>
one,” laughed Alexander. “But come, I dare say supper
is waiting and spoiling. I will show you the rest of your
little house to-morrow, and also your little carriage and pair
of ponies——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, <i>indeed</i> you do too much for me.—I think I have
not been used to having such things—of my own,” said
Drusilla, meekly and confusedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I <i>could not</i> do too much for you, dear love——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Mr. Alexander——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leave out the ‘Mr.’ from this time, sweet Drusa.
What were you going to say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was about to ask you, please, not to make me so many
presents.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, is that it? Why not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because—I love you. And—I only want you to give
me your love——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know all that, my pet. But let your conscience be at
rest. Every thing I seem to give you, as well as every thing
you have of your own is really not yours, but mine, because
you yourself are mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that so?” she smilingly inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then so I would have it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>While they talked they left the room, he leading the way
down the stairs, to the little drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was a very elegant apartment, fitted up in crimson
and gold curtains, chairs and sofas, rich mirrors and rare
paintings, and recherché articles of <i>virtu</i>. At the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>end of the room a heavy curtain of crimson satin damask,
with gold bullion fringe and gold cord and tassels, hung
from the ceiling to floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Drusilla was still gazing with curiosity and delight
upon the various objects of interest in the room, this curtain
was drawn aside as by invisible hands, revealing an
elegant little dining-room, where a luxurious supper was
spread.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander, with a laughing assumption of ceremony, led
Drusilla to the head of the table, bowed, and took his place
at the foot.</p>

<p class='c011'>A handsome negro boy, so like Pina as to be recognizable
at once for her brother, waited at table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear, this is your other servant—footman, coachman,
and groom—all in one. He is named Leander; but
for convenience we shall call him ‘Leo.’ Just as we call
his sister, who exults in the imperial name of Agrippina,
simply ‘Pina,’” said Alexander, as he placed the breast of
a roast pheasant on Drusilla’s plate.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a pleasant supper, as you may judge.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was followed by a happy evening.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='large'>THE WILD WOOD HOME BY DAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It is a quiet picture of delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pretty cottage hiding from the sun</div>
      <div class='line'>In the thick woods. We see it not till there,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I have the vaguest idea of the outside of our home—a
pretty brown cottage in evergreen woods—that was all I
could make out as we approached it in the twilight last
evening; and that is all I can make out now, while peering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>through that crimson curtained window,” said Drusilla, as
she sat at breakfast with her husband the next morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘A pretty brown cottage, in evergreen woods.’ Well,
that is all you would make out if you were to inspect the
premises most carefully every day for a month. It is a
new place, my little love. The house and stable only are
finished and walled in. The grounds are not laid out or
even cleared, as you may see by the thicket crowding up to
the very windows,” replied Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, I think I like it even better just so. There is
something very fascinating to me in the deep, wild wood,
where the trees may grow as they please, without touch of
ax or pruning knife, and where birds may sing and rabbits
run without fear of trap or fowling-piece,” said Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then if that be so, not a tree shall be felled, though we
should have to send to the city market for all our fruit and
vegetables,” laughed Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh no, no, no; don’t ‘Woodman, Spare That Tree’ on
my account. The woods are very charming, but so is a
garden with beds of growing vegetables and parterres of
blooming flowers; and so are vineyards and orchards, and
poultry-yards and cow-pens, none of which can be had
without the sacrifice of the woods. And you know what a
good little farmer your dear mother——” Here the tears
rushed to the bride’s eyes, but she quickly wiped them away
and smiled, saying: “No, I will not weep the day after our
wedding. I will remember that she is in Heaven, and—happy
as we may be, she is happier still.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what were you about to say, love, when you broke
off?” gravely and gently inquired Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I was going to remind you what a skillful little
farmer your dear mother had made of me, and to tell you
how well I can manage a little place like this, with the
help of the two servants.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, darling; but you will not need to do so. What?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>You worry with the cultivation of cabbage and onions, and
the rearing of fowls and turkeys, and the feeding of cows
and pigs? It is ridiculous, the idea!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But your dear mother saw to all such things with her
own eyes, and often helped among them with her own
hands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My venerated mother belonged to an old school of
housekeepers that are now obsolete, or fast passing away
before the progress of civilization. Machinery does the
work of laborers, and laborers have become intelligent directors
of machinery. Nonsense! Even if this were not so,
do you think I would let you spoil your exquisite beauty in
the way you propose, Drusa? No, my darling, your beauty
is too rare and rich to be put to any such uses. I think
that even if I were a very poor man, I would rather labor
day and night than you should soil your pretty hands,” he
whispered, lifting one of the little members of which he
spoke, and gazing on it with the eyes of a connoisseur and
the smile of a lover.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alexander! dear Alexander!” said the little bride,
earnestly, “please do not prize my looks so much. It
frightens me when you do so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why?” smiled the bridegroom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, because—one’s looks——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One’s beauty, you mean——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alexander, it is such an accidental and perishable
thing to be loved for. Illness or chance might destroy it in
a day; and time will certainly impair it in the course of
years. And whether I lose it sooner or later, what shall I
do if I lose your love also?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was spoken so gravely and feelingly that the bridegroom burst into a laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why you solemn little quiz! You remind me of a
little prig of a Sunday school scholar that I used to see
perched up in the corner of the housekeeper’s room in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>mother’s house in Richmond. A little ‘rum un’ who used
to sew quilt pieces and lecture lost sheep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But oh, tell me one thing. Even if I should grow
ugly, you would love me still, would you not, Alexander?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>You</i> grow ugly? impossible! Your beauty, if you
take common care of it, will last you until you are sixty
years old, and by that time, I, who am so much your senior,
will be so blind with age, or love, or habit, that I shall not
know whether you are a Venus or a Gorgon,” said Alexander,
laughing, and rising from the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Till I am sixty! So many years to live together, you
and I, if Heaven should spare us. Such a long and happy
life, if you only love me all the time. Oh, what can I do
to keep you loving me all these long, long years?” aspirated
Drusilla, in a sort of repressed fervor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be beautiful, be happy and love me—that is all,” he
answered. “And now put on some outer garment and
come with me, and I will show you what little is to be seen
of our small place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla took a gray hooded cloak from the hands of the
maid who had run and fetched it for her, and she wrapped
herself in it, drew the hood over her head, and took the
offered arm of Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>He led her out of the front door and down the step of
the porch to the broad carriage drive that had been cleared
through the cedars from the house to the gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a fine wintry day. A little snow had fallen during
the night, just sufficient to cover the ground with a white
garment and powder the cedars like coachmen’s wigs; but
the sky was now clear and the sun bright.</p>

<p class='c011'>They walked down the drive to the gate, and then, at
Alexander’s suggestion, turned about and leaned against the
gate, and faced the front of the cottage to take a look at it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A mere toy palace, or doll’s house, as I told you,” said
Alexander, disparagingly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“It is a beauty. But perhaps you are comparing it with
spacious Crowood or lofty Lyon Hall; in which case it must
suffer by comparison in size, I grant you, but not in
beauty,” said Drusilla, gazing on her home with perfect
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very glad you approve of it, darling, even in its
half finished condition. In another year I will see what
money and taste can do to convert it into a paradise for
you,” said Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The sweet spot is Arcadia already. But how were you
so fortunate as to get it, dear Alexander? And have you
rented it, or bought it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have taken it on trial for a year, with the privilege of
purchasing it, if I like it, at the end of that time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why does the owner wish to sell such a pretty place,
which he has only just built?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, love, it is a common case. The place was commenced
by a poor old fellow, who was about to retire from
business on a comfortable competency. But he put off
living too long, for just as he was preparing to do it he
died.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor man! and he never enjoyed the pretty place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us hope that he enjoys a better one. Meanwhile
we have the privilege of purchasing it, if we like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I do like it so much!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then consider it purchased, my pet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not on my account. Oh, Alexander, dear, please do
always what you judge to be best without thinking of me
in the matter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, darling, if I love you as you wish me to do, and
as I certainly do, I <i>must</i> think of your pleasure in everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked at him, secretly acknowledging the truth of
his words, yet much perplexed by them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The house upon which they gazed, incomplete as were its
surroundings, deserved all Drusilla’s praise.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>It was a charming little cottage ornée, which, if the
truth may be spoken, was much more suitable as the home
of a fresh young bride than the resting-place of a worn-out
old worldling. It was built after no particular plan, and
therefore perhaps all the more picturesque and pleasing in
its aspect. It was so irregularly and fantastically erected
as to defy all manner of description. From the outside it
seemed an eccentric collection of low walls and steep roofs,
gable ends, twisted chimneys, hanging balconies, bay-windows,
porches, verandahs, and so forth. Its dark gray
stone walls and dark green Venetian shutters and pillars
and cornices, so harmonized in hue with the colors of the
wintry woods, as at a short distance to mingle with them
and be indistinguishable from them. Such was the outside
of Drusilla’s little home.</p>

<p class='c011'>The inside was a collection of hexagon shaped halls,
chambers, parlors, quaint closets, cosy recesses and sunny
nooks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I will take you round and show you the stable and
the cow-house,” said Alexander, drawing his wife’s arm
within his own, and leading her around to the rear of the
house where, in a neat and well kept stable, he showed her
a pretty pair of gray ponies and a neat little carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked up in his face to thank him with her eyes, but
when she would have spoken, he stopped her with a kiss.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he took her to an adjoining compartment of the
same building, and showed her a white cow with a young
calf beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can not thank you enough; no, I can not—not only
for all that you have given me, but for the <i>beauty</i> of every
object and every living creature you have placed around me—the
beautiful house and furniture, the beautiful carriage
and ponies, the pretty white cow and calf. Dear Alexander,
I thank you so much for all the beauty with which you have
blessed my home,” smiled and faltered Drusilla, in a voice
broken by happy emotions.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Beauty! why who was it that, just now, begged and
prayed me not to love her for her beauty?” asked Alexander,
quizzingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was I, of course,” said Drusilla, blushing and laughing,
“but that was because I wished you to love me for
something deeper and more lasting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so I do, darling; but come—confess that you like
beautiful things—that you like even <i>me</i> better for not being
ill-looking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alexander, not you! it was never your looks,
although I like you to be handsome. But oh, dear Alick, if
you were to be maimed by accident or marked by illness, I
should love you quite as much as I do now, and even more
tenderly, I think, as I know I shall love you when you are
old and gray.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bah! I would rather die than grow old and gray; but
the time for that is far enough off, thank Heaven!” said
Alexander, as he led her back into the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>He took her into the drawing-room and showed her three
musical instruments, each of the very best quality—a piano,
a harp and a guitar. Upon a stand near was a collection of
old standard music, and of all the best new pieces out.</p>

<p class='c011'>I suppose no one but a monomaniac in music can understand
the delight of sitting down and trying the tone of a
new instrument of the very best order.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla placed herself at the piano, and ran her fingers
up and down the keys to test its powers. And then she
turned over her music and sang song after song, for hour
after hour, without weariness. And Alexander leaned over
her, and listened to her without flagging.</p>

<p class='c011'>When at length she arose from the piano, he led her
from the drawing-room and across the hexagon hall to an
opposite room, fitted up as a library. Here, in the elegant
book cases, were collected some of the best standard works
in English, French and German, also some choice Latin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>and Greek volumes, and a few of the most popular publications
of the day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here were neat writing desks, easy reading chairs, soft
foot cushions, and every means and appliance of comfort
and luxury.</p>

<p class='c011'>And on the walls were a few very choice pictures, and on
stands stood statuettes and vases and other gems of art, to
please a cultivated taste.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No words—you leave me no words to thank you for all
these blessings,” Drusilla murmured.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you they are all mine as you are mine, so there
are no words wanted for thanks,” smiled Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! but I know you did all this for me; I feel it and
I must say it, Alick, dear Alick,” she murmured, with tears
of love and joy in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the time they were in the library they heard the
songs of birds—a sound so unusual in that wintry season,
that Drusilla had looked up once or twice with a startled
expression; but as Alexander had only smiled at her surprise
without attempting to gratify her unspoken curiosity,
she forbore to ask him questions, and waited until he
should explain the mystery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come now,” he said, “I have something else to show
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he led her down to the lower end of the room, to a
green curtain that hung from ceiling to floor, and from side
to side, and corresponded, except in color, with that one
which divided the dining-room from the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>He drew aside this curtain and revealed a scene of enchantment.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a room of crystal glass, in gilded sashes, and it
was filled with the rarest and most beautiful exotic plants,
most of them in full bloom. Among these plants hung
large gilded cages, in which were birds of the most brilliant
plumage and the sweetest notes, whose songs filled all the
sunny and perfumed air with melody.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Birds and flowers of all the objects in nature had always
been Drusilla’s especial delight. Her love of them might
have been called a passion. And it had never been gratified
until now. And here she had them of the most beautiful
sorts, gathered in one splendid crystal room like a fairy
palace. And as she looked a smile of rapture lighted up
her lovely face, and then she turned towards the giver of
all these and tried to utter her feelings; but instead of
speaking, she burst into tears, threw herself in his arms,
and sobbed on his bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had overwhelmed her with his gifts, as he had done
once before.</p>

<p class='c011'>How smilingly he caressed and soothed her, until she
lifted up her head, dashed away her tears, and said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I am a fool to weep at what I am glad of,’ as Juliet,
or Lady Macbeth, or Regan, or Goneril, or some one of
Shakespeare’s women says.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miranda, my love; it was Miranda. Never misquote
Shakespeare; never even in your most confidential communications
to your most intimate friends; never even in soliloquy
and in solitude!” said Alexander, shaking his
head in mock gravity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed I wasn’t even sure it <i>was</i> in Shakespeare,” said
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now to the dining-room. I think we have earned
an appetite for dinner,” smiled Alexander, drawing her
arm within his own, and leading her from the library.</p>

<p class='c011'>This evening was spent in the drawing-room, where
tea was served.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so ended the second day of their bright honeymoon.</p>

      <div class='line'>And sweet the music of her step,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That met him at the door.—<span class='sc'>Drake.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For the first few days of their honeymoon, the bridegroom
stayed home with his bride—walking, riding, or
playing with her in the mornings, and reading, singing, or
conversing with her in the evenings.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Sunday, she asked him to take her to church, and
he took her to the nearest one of the sect to which she
belonged.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Monday, he took her into the city, to show her the
public buildings and other objects of interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, they remained
quietly at home. The weather was very inclement. It
had been raining three days, and the roads were very bad.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander spent the time in doors, in writing letters,
examining accounts, and reading to Drusilla, while she
worked with her needle. But the gay young man of the
world found this life “slow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On the third dull afternoon that the poor little bride had
tried her best to enliven, while he sat reading to her as she
sewed, he suddenly threw the book from him, got up,
yawned, walked up and down the room a few turns, looked
out of the window at the drizzling rain and gloomy sky,
and then turning to his companion, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusa, the weather is infernal, but—the German Opera
is in Washington, and our carriage is close. So what do
you say to braving the rain and the wind to see <cite><span lang="de">Der
Freichutz</span></cite> by the best troupe of artists that has ever appeared
in the city.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>She looked up quickly, and saw that he was anxious to
go. She replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be delighted, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not afraid of taking cold?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a bit! I would go through Noah’s Flood to hear
good music.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s my girl! You’re a brick. I’m so glad you are
not one of the timid or sickly sort. That little pale face of
yours is very deceptive, Drusa. One would think to look at
you that you were very delicate, but I never saw or heard
of your being sick my life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Except when I cried myself into a fit of illness, when
you went to Europe, Alick. Oh, I hope I shall never have
another such a trouble as that, as long as I live in this
world. I remember it yet. Alick, dear, I would rather die
than lose you for another two years,” she said with much
feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little goose! I’m not worth a tenth, a hundredth, no,
not a thousandth part of the love you bestow on me,” he
answered laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, I would not permit any one but yourself to
say such things of you. And I—I won’t let you say them
either, sir; so there, now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, run away and get ready. I will order the carriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla tripped up stairs to make her toilet. And
Alexander sauntered out of the room to give directions to
his factotum.</p>

<p class='c011'>In less than half an hour Drusilla came down, dressed for
the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>The carriage was at the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no tickets, of course; and consequently no
reserved seats. But, on such an inclement night as this, I
do not doubt that we shall be able to obtain good places,”
said Alexander, as he handed her into the carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>The roads were heavy, and so, a drive, that in good
weather could have been easily accomplished in thirty
minutes, occupied them for forty-five.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was rather late when they reached the National Theatre,
where the opera troupe were performing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The house was full, and the play had commenced.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon inquiry at the ticket-office, Alexander ascertained
that there were no good seats to be had, with the exception
of those in a stage box, that happened to be disengaged.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander at once took that, and guided by an usher, led
his companion thither.</p>

<p class='c011'>On taking her seat in the box, Drusilla’s eyes fell upon
what seemed to her a scene of enchantment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The house was filled with a fashionable and well-dressed
audience, and the opera was in full play. Drusilla had
never been in an opera before. The Christmas pantomimes
of her childhood comprised the whole of her experiences in
the theatrical line. Her artistic eye and ear at once
appealed to, she gazed with curiosity and interest, and listened
with wonder and delight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her attention was fixed upon the stage, but her bridegroom’s
was fixed upon her. As once before, in her childhood,
he had looked through her eyes, and heard through
her ears, and derived more pleasure from <i>her</i> pleasure, than
from the performance on the stage, so now he experienced a
keener delight in watching and wondering at</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The mind, the music breathing from her face,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>than in listening to the most divine strains of the singer,
who was charming the whole house.</p>

<p class='c011'>How beautiful she looked in her enthusiasm! She was
lovely always, even when pale and still, but now her lips
and cheeks glowed with that delicate, transparent fire, kindled
of emotion, and her eyes beamed with light, her whole
countenance was radiant and inspired.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>He was so much absorbed in contemplating her, that
he did not perceive she had attracted and was receiving
a great deal of attention from other quarters of the house.
Next to the figures on the stage, the occupants of the
“private” boxes have the most conspicuous position;
and if there is a new beauty among them, she is sure to
be discovered and stared at. Alexander had not thought
of this, or perhaps he would not have exhibited his little
beauty in a private box.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of the second act of the opera, however,
he was unpleasantly reminded of the fact. The box door
opened, and one of his gentleman acquaintances came in.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander arose and shook hands with him, but did
not ask him to be seated, although there were two spare
chairs; and did not present him to Drusilla, although
the visitor looked enquiringly at her, and Drusilla glanced
timidly in return.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before this gentleman left the box, another came, and
then another, until the little place was full. And Alexander
chatted gaily with them all, but presented not one
of them to Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the curtain arose for the third act, they all
bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla’s whole attention was once more given to
the stage, and Alexander’s to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, now that his notice had been attracted to the fact,
he could not help seeing that several opera glasses were still
levelled at his box.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will never bring her here again,” he muttered to himself,
frowning with a strangely blended feeling of gratified
pride in the admiration his beautiful bride had unconsciously
excited, and of morose jealousy that other eyes should
gaze on her so publicly at will. There was something of
the sultan in Mr. Lyon’s selfish nature, and he felt as if he
would have liked to shut up his little beauty from all the
world forever.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>He was heartily glad when the play was over. And
while the performers were still curtseying	 and bowing, and
the curtain was slowly rolling down, he hurried Drusilla up
from her seat, wrapped her cloak around her, and took her
off lest some of his unwelcome visitors should meet them on
their way out.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they were seated in their carriage, and the horses
were moving at a smart trot down Pennsylvania avenue
towards Seventh street, Alexander turned to his now quiet
companion, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were very much pleased, my little love?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, more than that; I have been in Heaven!” she
aspirated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You little enthusiast! But what makes you so quiet
now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have scarcely got back to earth, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusa, you saw those visitors that came into our box?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; they were friends of yours, and looked as if they
expected you to introduce them to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I dare say they did; but, Drusilla, did you wish
me to do so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I? I had no wish on the subject. But any friends of
yours, Alick, would be always most welcome to my
acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not so, little one. A man may have many friends that
he would not like to present to his wife. And these—were
roughs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Roughs?’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rude, unbroken colts, unfit for a gentlewoman’s society.
But let them pass. I only wished to explain why I did
not introduce them to you. Now as to the entertainment
of the evening. How did you like Xitz?” he inquired,
mentioning the tenor of the troupe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla went off into raptures over the tenor.</p>

<p class='c011'>And they talked of the opera and of nothing else until
they reached home.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Lights from the windows were gleaming through the
trees as they drove up to the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How bright and cheerful our little home looks,” said
Drusilla, as Alexander lifted her from the carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad you think so, love,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina opened the door, and smilingly admitted them.</p>

<p class='c011'>She took her mistress’s hood and cloak, while her master
relieved himself of his cap and overcoat.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then she opened the drawing-room door where a fine
fire was burning. And while they stood and warmed
themselves before its blaze she drew aside the crimson curtain
that shut off the dining-room, and revealed an elegant
little supper set out in readiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the evening closed as pleasantly as it had commenced.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander loved Drusilla; there is no doubt of that.
But as the days wore on he found life alone with her rather
dull. They had been married a fortnight before he left her
alone for a day. But on a certain morning he had his
horse saddled to ride in to Washington “to get the papers,”
he said, and to make arrangements for having them sent to
him every day. As he kissed Drusilla good-bye he added
that he should be back as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>She begged that he would not hurry himself for her sake.
She said she would occupy her time with dress-making
during his absence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you will be quite alone my poor little love,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall have pleasant thoughts for company,” she
answered; and she added: “Dear Alick, I do not wish to
be a hamper to your motions; never think of me as any
obstacle to your freedom. Please don’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As if I ever thought of anything else but you!”
replied the bridegroom, who was still a lover. And he
kissed her again and rode away.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>As soon as Alick reached the city he put his horse up at
a livery stable, and gave himself a holiday by sauntering
up and down Pennsylvania avenue, and lounging into the
various reading rooms of the hotels.</p>

<p class='c011'>In one of them he heard that an exciting polemic duel
was to come off that day in the Senate Chamber between
two distinguished Senators of opposite parties in politics.
Mr. W. of Massachusetts was expected to make a speech,
which Mr. C. of South Carolina was expected to answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Alexander determined to go with the crowd and
hear them.</p>

<p class='c011'>He lost no time in hurrying to the Capitol, and making
his way to the gallery of the Senate.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the very height of the Washington season, and the
city was as usual every winter, filled to overflowing.</p>

<p class='c011'>As many of the elite as could be pressed into that very
limited space was crowded into the gallery of the Senate
Chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander with much difficulty made his way into this
crowd. But Mr. Lyon was epicurean rather than intellectual,
and would not endure personal discomfort for the sake
of hearing the grandest burst of eloquence that ever thunderstruck
the world. So after experiencing something of
heat, pressure, and suffocation he turned his back upon the
“Godlike,” and pushed his way through the crowd in the
gallery to the crowd outside who were trying to get in, and
so slowly progressed to the library, were the “population”
was thinner and the air purer.</p>

<p class='c011'>He walked up to a table where several ladies and gentlemen
were gathered to look at some new illustrated volumes
that lay there for inspection.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the ladies turned around, and he found himself
face to face with his Cousin Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Good gracious, Alick</i>, who on earth would have expected
to see you here!” she exclaimed in astonishment, as
she offered her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>He turned red and pale; took and pressed the offered
hand, and then recovered himself and answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or <i>you</i>, Anna. I thought you were still at Old Lyon
Hall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I thought you were at Richmond, or rather I
had hoped you were by this time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My uncle is here with you, of course,” said Alexander,
wishing to avoid a topic which he saw upon the lips of his
cousin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, certainly, my grandfather is here. Our coming
was his act. He fancied—it was only fancy—that my
health and spirits were drooping in the country, and that I
needed a change, and so he brought me to Washington.
Of course being in mourning, we do not go to balls, only to
receptions where there is no dancing. But how is it that
you are here? Why are you not in Richmond?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope my uncle is quite well?” said Alexander, persistently
ignoring her questions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, quite. I was asking you why——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not see him; he is not with you this morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; he is on the floor of the Senate Chamber. But,
Alexander, I asked you why you are here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I too, needed a change,” he answered, smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! but surely, Alexander, can you know——By the
way, what have you been doing with yourself for the last
month in which we have not heard from you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here is a catechism! Wandering about to be sure;
trying to shake off a very disagreeable companion—meaning
myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>While he spoke she was regarding him with a very grave
face; but there was more of pity than rebuke in its expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick, you <i>cannot</i> know. When did you hear from
your home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not for four or five weeks.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“Then you <i>don’t</i> know. Oh, Alick, do you think it was
right to leave your home without giving your address, in
case anything should happen to require your presence. Oh,
Alick!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna, since the death of my dear father and mother, in
addition to the grief for their loss I have been oppressed
with the cares of the estate. I wished to get rid of trouble
for a little while. And so, to prevent old Dorset from
writing to me about business, I came away without leaving
my address.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And suppose, Alick, something of importance should
have required your attention in the meantime? Some
matter of life or death?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, thank Heaven, no such matter has turned up. I
see you before me in health and beauty. And I hear you
say that my uncle is quite well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And yet something has happened. Come with me,
Alick, to the window yonder,” said Anna, in a low voice, as
she walked off to a distant part of the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you really heard nothing from Dorset, Alick?”
she inquired, when they stood together at some distance
from every one else in the library.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I hope nothing has happened to the poor old
fellow?” said Alexander, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, not to him, or to any of the servants. Oh,
Alick, I am so sorry to be the first to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of what in the name of Heaven, Anna, since you and
your grandfather, and even old Dorset and the servants are
well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was there no one else in whom you took an interest?”
she gravely inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Richard Hammond? Poor Dick! Surely no misfortune——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no misfortune has befallen Dick; and neither do I
give you credit for caring a straw whether there has or has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>not. Nothing has happened to Dick but the inheritance of
a large fortune from a bachelor uncle in Brazil, which has
caused my grandfather to look on him with more tolerant
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very glad of Dick’s good fortune.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not give you credit for caring a fig for his fortune,
good or bad. But oh, Alick, I am grieved for you. Was
there no one else, no one else you cared for, left at home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, I cannot think of any other creature in whom
I could be expected to take so deep an interest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not—poor little Drusilla?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander gave a great guilty start and stood gazing at
his cousin. Drusilla had not been associated in his mind
with any one left at home; so he had had no suspicion that
Anna spoke of her; and now he wondered whether Anna
had any inkling of the truth. He doubted only an instant,
and then he felt sure by her words, looks and manners that
she had not. Yet he wished to know everything she had to
say of Drusilla’s flight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What of her?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, poor little thing! I grieve so much to tell
you. But after you left home, it seems she became moody,
silent, absent, and altogether queer. She took to wandering
off every day by herself. Dorset and Molly thought
that she was going deranged as her poor mother had gone.
So they watched her closely. But one day, about a fortnight
after you left home, she eluded their vigilance and
disappeared from the house. And though the most diligent
search was made for her, she could not be found.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna paused, and Alexander tried to look as much
shocked as she evidently expected him to be; but he could
not yet trust himself to make any comment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Old Dorset, nearly beside himself with distress, wrote
to my grandfather, telling him of what had occurred, and
asking for your address that he might communicate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>matter to you. Of course, not knowing it, my grandfather
could not give it. But I did hope the old man had discovered
your whereabouts and written to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, he has not. Dear me! Poor girl, poor girl! how
shocking! And no trace has been discovered of her yet?”
said Alexander, acting grief and anxiety as well as any
ordinary stage-player could.</p>

<p class='c011'>“None that I knew of.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bless my life, how dreadful! I must put advertisements
in all the papers and employ the detectives. What motive
does old Dorset assign to her act of leaving her home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Partial derangement, I tell you, inherited from her
mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor child! poor child! I will have inquiries set on
foot immediately. But—here comes General Lyon,” said
Alexander, glad to have a diversion from the very embarrassing
subject of Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>In fact, at that moment the old soldier entered the
library, looking to the right and left in search of his grand-daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Attended by Alexander, she went to meet him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, my dear, ready to go back to our hotel?—Ah,
Alexander, how do you do, my boy? Glad to see you.
How long have you been here?” he asked, cordially shaking
hands with his nephew.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I reached the city early this morning,” said Alexander,
speaking the <i>literal</i> truth, but giving a false impression, as
he meant to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! by the first train, eh?” exclaimed the old man,
jumping to the obvious conclusion. “But where do you
hang out, eh, my boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not taken rooms yet,” replied Alexander, who
found that he needed all his presence of mind to answer
these unexpected questions without betraying himself on
the one hand and perjuring himself on the other.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Ah! left all your luggage at the station, eh? Well, I
would advise you to take rooms at our hotel. We are
pretty comfortable there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How long do you propose to stay here, sir?” inquired
the young man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, the rest of the season, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was a dilemma. Of course, Alexander might have
ended all his embarrassments by candidly confessing his
marriage with Drusilla. And why did he not do so?
Simply because loving and admiring his young bride, as he
certainly did, he was nevertheless ashamed of having wedded
his housekeeper’s daughter; and he lacked moral courage
to face the astonishment of his cousin and the indignation
of his uncle, and to defend his own act and stand by his
own wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! but there is a sort of pride that is below contempt.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Alexander was wondering what he should do to
get out of his perplexities, his uncle changed the subject
back to the other dangerous theme by saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, by the way, that was a sad thing—the fate of poor
little Drusilla.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very sad, indeed, sir,” replied Alexander, lugubriously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must have shocked you terribly,” said the old
soldier.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” exclaimed Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well, it can’t be helped, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall do all I can in the premises, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no doubt, no doubt. Come, my dear Anna, let us
get on. Alick, come home with us to dinner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander would have made excuses. He was not dressed
for dinner, he said. He had no means of making his toilet.</p>

<p class='c011'>But his uncle cut him short.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense, man, nonsense. Who expects you to be in
full dress to-day? You are a traveller, just arrived in the
city. You have left your luggage at the station, and you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>have not even engaged rooms yet. Besides—at a hotel table,
who cares how you are dressed? Come along.
There! give Anna your arm, and take her to the carriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What could Alick do?</p>

<p class='c011'>He offered his arm to his cousin and led her down the
many broad steps leading to the east front of the capitol,
where the carriage waited. He handed her carefully in to
her cushioned seat, and bowed and attempted some excuse
for leaving her.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Anna, seized with some inexplicable whim, perhaps
inspired by the Spirit of Evil for his torment, would not
let him off; but insisted upon his entering and taking a
seat beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a suppressed groan, Alexander obeyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old soldier followed them into the carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he was comfortably seated and the horses had
started, he rubbed his hands and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is fortunate. I needed some one whom I could
trust, to take Anna out in the evening. Who so proper an
escort as her betrothed husband? Now this evening there
is to be a grand reception at the Executive Mansion. I do
not feel well enough to go out at night, so I must impress
you into the service, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should be most happy, sir,” said the young man,
actually trembling under his accumulating embarrassment.
“I should indeed be delighted, but——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what?—Oh, nonsense, you cannot make any excuse
about your toilet in this case; there is plenty of time to get
your luggage from the station, and get yourself up for the
evening in the most unexceptionable style.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir, but——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what, again? You cannot possibly have any other
engagement. You have been in the city too short a time.
Alexander, what has come to you? You are not like yourself
at all. I really think your betrothed has a reason to
feel piqued,” said the old man, gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“I beg your pardon and hers, sir—I am—if I must
speak the truth, a little upset upon the subject of that poor
girl,” said Alexander, in explanation, again speaking the
literal truth, while intentionally giving a wrong impression.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh exactly, to be sure, my dear boy, and it does you
credit. I am certain I ought to beg <i>your</i> pardon, now, for
doing injustice to your good feelings. But Alick, my lad,
your compassion for that poor child need not prevent you
from ordinary social pleasures. You really must escort
your cousin to the President’s reception to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear grandfather,” put in Anna, “I will not, if you
please, have any gentleman pressed into my service against
his will, even though that gentleman should be my
affianced husband. Dick is in Washington. He called on
me this morning, and begged leave to attend me to the
White House this evening. I told him I would hold his
proposal in reserve, and let him know in time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now what was there in the name of his old rival, poor
Dick, that should have raised Alexander’s jealousy? Mr.
Lyon was a married man, and had no right to feel annoyed
at the idea of Richard Hammond becoming the escort of
his cousin. Nevertheless he <i>did</i> feel annoyed, partly, perhaps,
because he had once considered Anna his own property,
and however lightly he had valued the possession, he
could not, even now, see her pass over to another without a
secret feeling of rage and jealousy; and so he hesitated to
answer:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, my dear cousin; if you please, I claim the right
of attending you in person. I can not resign that right to
Mr. Hammond.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And <i>I</i> claim the right of choosing my own escort,”
said Anna, proudly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander bowed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Girl and boy, I will have no lovers’ quarrels here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Anna, you should feel that there is an impropriety in an
engaged young lady accepting the attentions of another
gentleman, when her betrothed is anxious to show her those
attentions himself. Alexander, you are to take Anna to
the reception this evening. Young people, both see that
you obey me. <i>Some</i> respect should be paid to my gray
head and my eighty years,” said the old soldier, with dignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both the young people bowed and acquiesced. And so
it was settled that Alexander should attend Anna to the
reception of the evening.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Alexander went with his uncle and cousin to their
hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, my boy,” said the old gentleman, after he
had dismissed the carriage and taken his grand-daughter
into the private entrance, “let us lose no time in going to
the office and securing your rooms. Guests are arriving by
every train, and the house is in a fair way of being
crowded if it is not so already. Indeed, I fear you may
not, even now, be able to obtain rooms here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven grant I may not!” was the fervent, though
silent, aspiration of Mr. Lyon, who was almost at his wits’
ends with perplexity.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the strong hope that there was no room to be had, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>let his uncle drag him along to the counter of the office,
which was crowded with applicants for accommodations.
It was some minutes before General Lyon could get audience
with the sorely embarrassed clerk of the house. When
he did, it was to receive the answer that the crowded state
of the office led him to anticipate.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was not a room nor a half a room, nor a bed nor a
half a bed, at the disposal of the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought so. Well, Alick, I am sorry; but you must
try to get rooms as near us as possible. I don’t think the
Blank House is full yet. It is too far up town for
strangers. But hark ye! it will be full in an hour from
this time. ‘Make hay while the sun shines.’ Run, now;
jump into a cab and drive for life to the Blank, and engage
your rooms before this crowd gets there and tills the
house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, what could Alexander do? He saw at a glance
that he must ostensively live at Washington—that he must
have rooms at some hotel, though he might never, or very
seldom, occupy them. And he was only too glad that he
was not obliged to have rooms in the same house with his
uncle, and so be always under the old gentleman’s eye.</p>

<p class='c011'>He thanked General Lyon for his advice, and said that
he should avail himself of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he went out and jumped into the first cab that
offered, and drove to the Blank House, where he happened
to be in time to engage the only bedroom at the disposal of
the proprietor.</p>

<p class='c011'>He took the key of his room, which he meant only to
occupy on his occasional visits to the city, and then he
drove to the “establishment” of a fashionable tailor and
gentleman’s outfitter, and he suited himself with a full evening
dress, including linen, gloves, perfumery, et cetera.
These he ordered to be sent to his room at the Blank
House.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“I am booked for his Excellency’s reception this evening,
and so it will be considerably after midnight before I can
hope to get back to Cedarwood. Poor little Drusa! I
hope she won’t be anxious, and sit up and lose her rest,” he
said, as he hurried back to his hotel to make his toilet for
the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>While waiting for his parcel from the tailor’s he lounged
into the reading room, and took up one of the evening
papers; but its columns could scarcely engage his attention,
which was wholly engrossed by his embarrassments.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is now near sunset,” so ran his thoughts, “and poor
little soul! she has been watching for me for hours, is
watching for me at this moment, and will watch for me for
hours longer, until long after midnight, tormented by
nobody knows how many fears and fancies concerning me.
Plague take the old man! what brought him bothering to
Washington just at this time?” very irreverently muttered
Mr. Lyon to himself, as his eyes ran over the news items of
the paper without taking cognizance of their meaning.</p>

<p class='c011'>His ostensible reading and his real reverie was rudely interrupted
by the clap of a hand upon his shoulder, and the
ring of a laugh in his ear.</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned sharply around and recognized Captain Reding
and Lieutenant Harpe, two young officers of the army, who
had been among the visitors to his box on the evening
when he had taken Drusilla to the German Opera.</p>

<p class='c011'>He bowed coldly in rebuke to their laughter, but they
took no offence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hey, old boy! so here you are at last!” said Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have been looking for you for days—ever since we
saw you at the German Opera with that pretty little girl,”
said Harpe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where have you been hiding yourself all this time?”
inquired Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And above all, where have you hidden that little
beauty, you churlish fellow?” added Harpe.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“You never presented us to her,” said Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! we owe you one for that,” added Harpe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gentlemen,” answered Mr. Lyon, slowly and coldly
collecting his thoughts, “if you will be good enough to
speak, one at a time, and forbear a second question until a
first is answered, perhaps I may be able to satisfy your
curiosity. On the evening to which you allude I happened
to be passing through Washington, having in my charge
the daughter of a clergyman. She was the very young
lady whom you saw with me at the opera. I made no stay
in the city beyond that evening; but took my young charge
immediately to her home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And in this statement also Mr. Lyon told something
near the literal truth, while intentionally giving a false
impression.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, well,” said Reding, “but why did you not introduce
us to the little beauty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you must have it, I did not think two gay young
blades like yourselves very desirable acquaintances for a
clergyman’s daughter,” said Mr. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you were!—oh! oh! oh!” laughed Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deuce take it, what do you mean by that, Alick?” inquired
Mr. Harpe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing against your honor, gentlemen. If my charge
for the evening had been any other young lady in the
world, I would have presented you to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Much obliged,” said Reding; “but to tell you the
truth, Lyon, whether you like it or not, the young person
in question did not impress us as being a young lady.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean by <i>that</i>?” exclaimed Mr. Lyon, in
a low, stern voice, as he glared at the speaker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, nothing against <i>her</i> honor—nothing in the world.
I mean simply that the little creature seemed to us to be,
not exactly of ‘low birth,’ but of ‘humble parentage,’ as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>phrase goes. She had not the manners of good society,”
answered Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven forbid she ever should have,” said Alexander,
firmly. And yet the criticism galled him; all the more,
perhaps, because he felt it to be the truth. His lovely
young wife had not, as these critics said, the manners of
“good society.” Yet it was hard to say what she lacked.
Whatever it was, it was something in which Miss Anna
Lyon, a very queen in society, excelled. What was it,
then? Drusilla was pretty, graceful, well educated, and
well-dressed. She excelled in many accomplishments, and
was conversant with the history of the past and the literature
of the present, and she conversed intelligently upon
all these. She was sweet, gentle and courteous in her deportment
to all persons. What then did she lack? I will
tell you—self-esteem and self-possession—both of which
qualities are in high favor in “good society.” Drusilla’s
manner was that of one who had always occupied a subordinate
position by living among her superiors. She had too
little of assurance and too much of deference.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this delicate and retiring manner, which had been
one of her sweetest charms in the eyes of her lover, now
suddenly became objectionable in the estimation of her
husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” he muttered to himself, “she has <i>not</i> the air of a
lady; she has the air of a maid-servant. Poor little thing!
I fear I shall never be able to introduce her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No offence, I hope, Alick!” said young Harpe, good-humoredly, noticing Mr. Lyon’s gloomy abstraction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“None in the world,” answered Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because, if there should be, I am ready to fight or
apologize, or to give you any sort of satisfaction you may
please to demand,” laughed the young lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ask as a favor that you will drop the subject of this
young lady; for she is a lady by position, if not—according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>to your judgment—in manners. And now, gentlemen, as I
have an engagement, I must wish you good evening,” said
Mr. Lyon, bowing and withdrawing from their proximity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” he said, as he went slowly up to his room, “I
must not bring Drusilla into public again. Her beauty excites
attention and her simplicity provokes criticism, and
both raise questions difficult to meet. Poor little Drusa,
she must always be a hidden treasure, a secret ‘well-spring
of joy’ to me. Well, she will not object to that, and she
will be all the lovelier and the sweeter for this seclusion,”
he added, in some self-satisfaction, as he entered his room
and began to dress for the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as he was ready he went down to the dining-room,
took a single cup of strong tea, and then passed out
to the sidewalk and called the best-looking cab that he
saw upon the stand.</p>

<p class='c011'>A short drive took him to the hotel where his uncle and
cousin were stopping. He was shown up into their private
parlor, where they were awaiting him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are late, Alick,” said Anna, advancing from the
fire to meet him half way across the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had to wait for my parcels,” replied Alexander, bowing
and smiling apologetically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, your luggage from the railway station? Well, the
porters <i>are</i> slow, that is certain; but then they have so
much to do,” said old General Lyon, drawing a natural
inference.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander bowed in an absent sort of a manner, but did
not reply. He was gazing at his cousin. How grandly
beautiful she looked, how graceful, how stately! Ah! <i>she</i>
had the air, not only of “good society,” but of the best
society! And that upstart puppy, that good for nothing
Dick Hammond, to aspire to her. Ugh!</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the tenor of Mr. Alexander’s thoughts as he
stood for a moment contemplating his beautiful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>imperious-looking cousin. In fact, Anna was at an age
when every season added to her beauty. Always well-looking,
she had never in her life looked so well as to-night.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wore a deep mourning full dress of black crape, over
a black silk. It was made with a low corsage and short
sleeves; both sleeves and corsage were edged with a narrow
trimming of fine white thule; and the fairness of her perfect
neck and arms were set off by a necklace and bracelets
of jet. Her golden auburn hair was in plain rolls at the
back of her head, and a band of jet above her forehead was
its only ornament. This simple mourning dress set off her
blonde beauty more completely than the most elaborate
toilet could have done.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am ready, Alick. What are you waiting for?” she
inquired, breaking in upon the spell that bound him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing,” he answered, with a slight start. “I am at
your service this instant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he stepped towards her, and fastened the glove on
the hand that she held out to him. And then he wrapped
her opera cloak carefully around her shoulders, tied the little
hood under her chin, drew her arm within his own, and led
her from the room down to the carriage, wondering all the
way how it was that his cousin Anna, whom he had only
known as a rather pretty girl so long, should so suddenly
have become so beautiful in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! Mr. Lyon, she had grown beautiful to you only in
becoming unattainable by you. A common case.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old General Lyon followed them closely, and saw Alick
put Anna into her seat, and tuck her wrappings carefully
around her, and then get in and place himself beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take care of her, Alick; the night is growing colder,”
said the old gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall take the best care of her, sir,” replied Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna, mind, you are not to stay late,” said Anna’s
grandfather.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“‘Late?’—Who stays late at a President’s reception?
Everybody—that is, almost everybody, leaves before twelve.
I shall be back by half-past eleven, sir. It is only to make
one’s bow or courtesy to his Excellency in the Reception
Room, and walk once or twice through the East Room, and
come away,” laughed Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, I shall sit up for you,” said General Lyon,
by way of sealing the bargain, as he retreated from the
carriage door.</p>

<p class='c011'>The coachman put up the steps, clapped to the door,
mounted his box, and drove off.</p>

      <div class='line in2'>And maddening carnival.—<span class='sc'>Anon.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I was so upset by what you told me, Anna, that I
really forgot to ask you how long you have been in the city,”
said Alexander, as soon as the horses were in motion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have been here just four days,” answered Miss
Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have not been out much?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; my grandfather has a crotchet that one must make
one’s first appearance in public at the President’s reception.
This is the first one that has been held since our arrival,
and consequently the first evening that I have been out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very fortunate in being here to go with you,” said
Alexander, this time speaking, to his shame, quite truly;
for he <i>was</i> glad to escort his beautiful cousin, if only to
prevent Richard Hammond from doing so.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“Thanks,” she answered, very coldly, as if not believing
his statement, or not valuing it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The very short distance between the hotel they had left
and the palace to which they were going was soon accomplished,
and the carriage was drawn up in the rear of some
fifty others that occupied the drive leading to the doors of
the Executive mansion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There seems to be a great crowd here to-night,” said
Alexander, while they waited their turn to drive up to the
door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is always a crowd here in the month of February,
I believe. It is in this month that the city is full of
strangers—literally <i>full</i>, Alick,” replied Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was twenty minutes before their carriage slowly
worked its way up before the main entrance of the mansion.
Then Alexander handed his companion down from her seat,
and took her up the broad steps leading into the front hall
of the palace.</p>

<p class='c011'>A President’s reception has been described so often that
there is no need of a description here.</p>

<p class='c011'>The reception of this evening in its general features
differed from none of its predecessors or its successors.
There was the same crowd of carriages on the drive, the
same stream of foot passengers on the walk, and the same
crush of guests in the hall, in the cloak rooms, in the corridors,
in the ante-rooms, in the audience-chamber, in the
reception room, and in the east drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having each deposited their outer wrappings respectively
in the gentlemen’s and the ladies’ cloak rooms, Alexander
and Anna met at the door of the latter. He drew her arm
within his own, and they soon found themselves in a crush
of crinoline and broadcloth, and an atmosphere of patchoula
frangipani, being forced forward through the corridor and
the ante-room into the reception room. In due time they
were pressed up to the presence of the President and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>suite; but they had scarcely made their respective bow and
courtesy, and touched his Excellency’s hand, before they
were carried onward through other rooms into the east
drawing-room, where they found a little more space and
freedom of motion.</p>

<p class='c011'>A military hand was playing a national march, to the
measure of which nearly half the company were promenading
in a procession around and around the saloon in a manner
which, to a new comer, must have looked simply
idiotic.</p>

<p class='c011'>Others of the assembly were seated on the various sofas
and divans that lined the walls of the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you take a seat or a promenade?” inquired Alexander
of his companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, a promenade, by all means,” replied Anna. “I
like the perfect vacuity of mind that falls upon one in that
orbit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander drew her arm closer within his own, and they
fell into the procession. Immediately before them walked
a foreign minister, in his official costume, conducting a lady
of high rank and fashion. Immediately behind them came
a general officer with a reigning belle upon his arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the reign of this belle was over from this evening.
Her successor had arrived.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander and Anna had not made the circuit of the
room twice, before he saw that his companion was, “the
observed of all observers” in the place. He saw eyeglasses
levelled at her; he heard whispered questions concerning
her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is she, that beautiful girl in black crape and
jet?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he heard the whispered answers:</p>

<p class='c011'>“A new debutante in the beau monde, I fancy.” Or—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know, but that is young Lyon, of Richmond,
who is escorting her.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Splendid woman!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Magnificent creature!” Etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he saw and heard all this, Alexander was strongly
affected with contradictory emotions. If the beautiful girl
by his side had been undisputably his own, he might have
witnessed the sensation she created, with unmixed pride
and pleasure. But he had by his own rash act, lost his
own once exclusive right over her, and even put himself
beyond the circle of ordinary aspirants for her favor. And
now the universal admiration her beauty excited, aroused
his dog-in-the-manger jealousy, rather than flattered his
pride.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, upon the whole, not liking the situation, he stooped
and whispered to his cousin:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I lead you to a seat now, Anna?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he took her to a distant sofa, gave her the corner of
it, and placed himself by her side.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he gained nothing by the motion. On the contrary,
he lost.</p>

<p class='c011'>No sooner were they seated, than up came Richard
Hammond, confident and smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna received him with the utmost graciousness.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he stood before her, talking and laughing with her
very gaily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Other gentlemen friends, whom Anna had met on former
occasions, came up and paid their respects, and lingered
near her. Her lady friends, a few of whom were present,
also sought her out, and greeted her with much apparent
gladness, and introduced <i>their</i> friends to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was not room on the sofa for all these ladies. So
Anna, deeming it discourteous to sit, where so many were
standing, arose from her seat and stood up. And very soon
a circle of the most distinguished men and the most brilliant
women in the assembly was formed around her. And
she seemed as a queen, receiving the homage of her court.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Presently, a general buzz in the crowd announced some
interesting event, and before the little excitement subsided,
the commanding form of the President was seen passing
with his suite through the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>In due course, he drew near the circle that surrounded
Miss Lyon. On seeing that young beauty, he immediately
passed through the circle that divided to admit him, and
stood before her, holding out his hand, and saying, in a
fatherly and familiar manner:</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you do, my dear? I am very glad to see you
here, this evening. But where is my old friend, the
General?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Lyon, with a deep courtesy, explained that her
grandfather’s precarious state of health deprived him of
the honor of waiting on his Excellency.</p>

<p class='c011'>The President expressed his regret at this. And then
instead of passing on and dispensing his courtesies impartially
among his guests, he lingered near the beautiful Anna,
apparently as much fascinated by her charms, as the youngest
man in his presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Full half an hour he stood talking with the beauty, and
then reluctantly bowed his adieux, and immediately left the
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>This seemed the signal for the breaking up of the
assembly.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then followed other leave-takings, and the pressure
through the corridors to the cloak rooms; and the confusion
of tongues and of properties there, and the crush in the
hall, and finally, the escape into pure, bracing air of the
clear starlight night on the outside.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander and Anna had to wait the turn of their carriage
to drive up.</p>

<p class='c011'>When, at length, they were comfortably seated within it,
Alexander took out his watch, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Half-past twelve o’clock, and we promised to be home at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>half-past eleven. We have kept your grandfather waiting
for an hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he thought with compunction of one other whom he
had kept waiting much more than an hour.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were driven rapidly to the hotel. On their arrival,
Alexander helped Anna out of the carriage and hurried her
into the house, for the night was sharp.</p>

<p class='c011'>They found General Lyon up, and expecting them, with
much impatience.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An hour behind time, Anna,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The President detained me in conversation, to the envy
of all his other lady guests,” laughed Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you will forgive her delay,” said Alexander, “in
consequence of her conquest of our President. I consider
it a great success.”</p>

      <div class='line'>As yet ’tis midnight deep, the weary clouds,</div>

      <div class='line'>The while the drowsy world lies lost in sleep.—<span class='sc'>Thomson.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As soon as Alexander Lyon had bid good night to his
uncle and cousin, he hurried to the livery stable where he
had left his horse, doubting that it would be open at so late
an hour.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was not yet closed for the night; so upon Mr.
Lyon’s requirement one of the hostlers led out the horse,
already saddled and bridled for the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A dark night, sir,” said this official, as he put the reins
in the hands of the rider.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and a dark road before me,” replied the young
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“I hope for your sake it isn’t a long one, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is about five miles directly in the face of the wind,”
laughed Mr. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sorry to hear it on your account, sir. The weather’s
sharpish. The wind’s got round to the northud and
blows up pretty keenish. I wish you well at your journey’s
end, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. Good night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good night, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander rode briskly away.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night had grown bitterly cold; but his horse was
fresh, and the rider thought that in such weather as
this it would do the beast no harm to ride him hard.
So he put him into a gallop, and soon left the gas-lighted,
populous streets behind, and found himself in a dark and
lonely road, where nothing was to be seen on either side
but wintry woods and stubble fields, frozen brooks and
straggling fences, and at long intervals some isolated dwelling.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length he came to the old turnpike road leading through
the woods towards his home. Here it was necessary to
slacken speed; for the road was obstructed in many places,
and the sky was very dark. So he drew rein at the
entrance of the wood, and went on in a walk.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding the rapidity with which he had galloped
over the five miles on the Seventh street road, his blood was
half stagnant with the cold. His face, after smarting
fiercely in the wind had lost all sense of feeling, and his
hands were so numb that he could scarcely hold the bridle.</p>

<p class='c011'>In addition to his physical discomfort he experienced
much mental disturbance; and both together made him
irritable and angry with himself and all the world. He
was vexed with his uncle and cousin for being in Washington:
with Richard Hammond for being always at hand to
wait upon the beautiful heiress; with the old man in Brazil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>for dying and leaving the young spendthrift a fortune to
recommend him; and, above all, with himself—not exactly
for having married poor little Drusilla, but certainly for
having by his own act put it out of his power to marry
Anna; and <i>worse</i> than all, he was vexed in advance with
his sweet little wife for the reception he felt sure she would
give him when he should get home.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he rode slowly through the woods he muttered to himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I <i>know</i> she has been watching for me ever since noon
to-day, just because I said that I would be home then.
She has been watching more than twelve hours. And now
of course she has worried herself into a fit of intense anxiety,
and most likely of illness besides. And there she is,
no doubt, sitting with a pale face and red eyes, weeping
over a smouldering fire, or an extinguished one. And she
will meet me either with tears or sorrowful reproaches, or
both! And, after all, what can I say for myself? Ah,
bah, why will women take such things so much to heart?
As if it was not enough to have been driven almost to
mental distraction for her sake to-day, without being subjected
to a scene to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So growling within himself, the culprit rode slowly
onward towards his home, and the nearer he got to it the
more slowly he rode. He actually dreaded to meet Drusilla.
But ride on slowly as he might, he could not put off
forever the inevitable moment of arrival.</p>

<p class='c011'>He soon saw the light of his home gleaming through the
trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, I knew it!” he said to himself. “She <i>is</i> sitting
up for me. There are the drawing-room windows all
ablaze, and not a shutter closed. I had a faint hope that
she might have gone to bed and cried herself to sleep, like
a child as she is. But that’s all over now. I’ve got to
meet her with her red eyes and pale face. Confound it all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>if she does get up a scene, I’ll teach her a lesson she’ll not
soon forget!” he growled, trying to work himself up into
a fit of rage in anticipation of the dreaded meeting. And
yet, in the midst of all his efforts, his heart reproached him,
and he relented a little towards his young wife. So now it
was half in anger and half in compunction he drew near
his home.</p>

<p class='c011'>To give himself more time, to postpone the evil hour as
long as possible, he first rode around to the stable to put up
his horse himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then he walked slowly to the house and knocked at
the front door.</p>

<p class='c011'>It flew open on the instant.</p>

<p class='c011'>And there stood Drusilla, warm, glad, beaming with
delight, radiant with welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I heard you come,” she exclaimed—“I heard you ride
around to the stable first, and so I was here ready to open
for you. But oh! how cold you look. Come in quickly,”
she said, taking him by his frozen hands and drawing him
into the hall, and then closing and bolting the front door
with her own nimble fingers.</p>

<p class='c011'>For an instant he was so “taken aback” by her unexpected
manner that he positively shrank from her. But the
next moment he caught her and folded her to his bosom, as
he murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My darling, darling child! My own dearest and best
little Drusilla! how could I ever leave you! Heart of my
heart, I will never leave you again for a whole day alone as
long as I live in this world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rash vow! but he meant, at the moment, to keep it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that is what I am,” she whispered—“heart of
your heart. That is the sweetest and the truest name you
ever called me. And now let me help you off with your
overcoat, and then you can come into the drawing-room.
There is a good fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>He let her assist him in taking off his coat, and then he
followed her into the drawing-room, where, as she had said,
there was a good fire. His easy chair was standing before
it, and his furred slippers were lying on the rug. And she
had even brought down the boot-jack and laid it by the
slippers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the easy chair stood a small round table, covered
with a white damask cloth and laid for two persons.</p>

<p class='c011'>A bright tea-kettle sat singing before the fire, and two
small silver covered dishes sat upon the hearth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seeing these simple preparations for his comfort and seeing
the happy little creature who had made them, his heart
smote him, first for having left her alone so late, and then
for having entertained such hard thoughts of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My darling child, how kind of you to do all this for me.
But I am sorry you took the trouble,” he said, putting his
arm around her and drawing her towards him where he sat
in his resting chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But suppose it made me happy to do it? Suppose it
interested and amused me while waiting for you?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ‘waiting’ indeed! how long you have waited! I
was in hopes that you had gone to bed and gone to sleep;
but when I saw the lights in the drawing-room windows, I
knew that you were still up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I left the shutters open on purpose; I thought the light
would look cheerful to you as you rode home through the
woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear heart! I ought to have known your loving motive
as I came along; but I didn’t. Ah, weren’t you tired
and sleepy with waiting?” he asked, as he drew her on
his knee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why no. It is not so <i>very</i> late, after all. And I have
sat up many and many a night later than this only to
finish a piece of needle-work I happened to be pleased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>with, or book I was interested in. And wouldn’t I much
sooner sit up to give my dearest a good warm supper
after his long, cold ride?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My pet, my love, my darling, my—oh! what can I
call you that will be good enough and dear enough for
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call me no hard names at all,” she said, gayly, kissing
him and springing from his lap. “But take off your boots
while I put supper on the table.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor little Drusilla, these arrangements of hers were not
according to the usages of “good society.” Now, Anna
Lyon would have let her husband go up to the top of the
house in the cold before she would have permitted the boot-jack
to be brought into the drawing-room; and would have
let him broken his fast in a dreary dining-room, or even
gone hungry and thirsty to bed, before she would have
allowed a kettle to be boiled, or a supper to be laid, in the
drawing-room. And only a few hours before this Alexander
had been lamenting in his heart his little wife’s deficiencies
in the manners of “good society.” But now he
was hungry and cold, and so,—flagrant as her breach of
etiquette was, he did not seem to see it; he only realized
that he was at this moment the happiest man, with the
loveliest wife, in existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The supper was soon placed upon the table. Of the two
silver covered dishes, one was found to contain a pair of
nicely roasted partridges, and the other equally well roasted
potatoes. Besides these, there was a fresh salad prepared,
as he thought none but Drusilla could prepare it. And
there were light biscuits and delicate jellies and fresh fruits.
And there were “schnapps” and lemons and loaf sugar,
and all the materials for the hot punch that she thought he
would like after his cold ride.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me, darling,” said Alexander, after he had refreshed
himself with these viands, and was taking his ease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>between the table and the fire, “tell me how you have
passed the lonely day. Were you very lonely and very
anxious?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” she answered, “I wasn’t lonely. I was very busy,
and I was thinking of you, and looking for you. And—yes,
I am forced to admit that I was a little anxious.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor child! I had promised to be home at noon.
What did you think, and what did you do when I failed to
come?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought something had detained you a little, and that
you would be home very soon; and—I took a cup of tea and
bit of toast for lunch,” laughed Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And afterwards, when hour after hour passed, until our
late dinner time came, what then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I waited, expecting you every minute, until some
hours past our dinner-time, and then—I ate my own dinner
and had yours put away to be kept warm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wise little girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I scarcely thought you would need the dinner. I
fancied you were dining with some friend you had met in
the city, and that <i>that</i> was keeping you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little witch! And then when it grew dark and
late?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, <i>then</i> I grew a little nervous about you, and had
ever so many foolish imaginations—that robbers had
attacked you on the dark road, or that the horse had thrown
you, or some other fatality had overtaken you; and so I
was troubled with anxiety. But I reasoned and fought
against that anxiety. I said to myself how much more
likely it was that you were spending the evening with some
friend; and then I recollected that the Italian Opera was
in Washington, and I thought it most probable that you
had gone there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! well, and what next?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, about ten o’clock I called in Pina and told her as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the night was so sharp, and the ride so long, you would
need a warm supper when you should arrive; and that we
must get one up between us for you. And so Pina dressed
the partridges, and I made the salad and set the table, and—that
was how it was. And when all was ready I made
Pina and Leo go to bed, because the poor creatures have to
rise so early in the morning. And I told them to leave the
shutters open, that the light might be a beacon to you on
this dark night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My darling, darling child! I always knew that your
nature was as sweet as a saint’s, but I never knew how
heavenly sweet, until to-night! You have given me such
loving welcome! You have not even <i>looked</i> a reproach to
me for disappointing you, and you have not once asked me
why I did it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She stopped his words with kisses. And with her arm
around his neck, and her cheek laid against his, she
whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“As if I hadn’t faith in you. As if I didn’t love you
and trust you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you dove! I would not give you for Anna Lyon
and all the fine ladies that live, or ever did, or ever will
live!” he said, warmly embracing her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope,” she whispered, softly, “that you would never
wish to give me up for any one; not that I am better than
others; not that I am so good as they; but because I am
your own, and you love me. But what made you think of
Miss Lyon just then, dearest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, because, you know, it was planned between our
parents, that Anna and I should marry, whether we liked
to do it or not; fortunately, neither of us liked to do it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Fortunately;’ oh yes, how very fortunately! I cannot
bear to think what I should have done, if you had
married Miss Lyon,” said Drusilla, with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander wished to divert the conversation from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>dangerous topic to which he had so thoughtlessly led it, so
he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you thought I had gone to the Italian Opera, this
evening, did you, my little love?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I thought you had dined with some friend, and
then had gone with him to see Lucia di’ Lammermoor.
Had you not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, my darling, no; I wouldn’t have left you alone all
the evening, for the sake of hearing the grandest opera
ever written and played.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wouldn’t you, Alick? But you might have done so.
I shouldn’t have thought hard of it. I couldn’t expect you
to be tied down to me all the time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, my darling, I wouldn’t have, broken faith with you
and stayed away, when I promised to be home, for any
amusement under the sun. And nothing but the most
urgent necessity should have kept me away on this occasion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Alick, nothing disagreeable to you, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only disagreeable, love, in so far as it detained me from
your side.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I am glad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was only—some unexpected business connected with
my late father’s will,” said Alexander, hesitatingly, and
again speaking a literal truth to give a false impression.
For certainly his embarrassments with Anna Lyon did
grow out of his father’s will—will that he, Alexander,
should marry her.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Drusilla understood him as speaking in a financial
sense only—as he intended that she should; and she brightened
up and answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, well, Alick, dear, since it was not very vexatious
business, never mind if it <i>did</i> keep you away from me a
few hours longer than you or I expected. I can not hope
to have you always here beside me; but you are here now;
and all is made up to you, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“Yes, dear heart of my heart, all is made up to me now,”
said Alexander, folding her fondly to his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the night that he had dreaded so much closed in
this perfect peace.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The day and night described in the last chapter were the
types of many, too many days and nights that followed
them. Alexander Lyon had placed himself in a false position
and had a very difficult part to play between his wife
and his betrothed.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the morning after that little supper the young couple
slept late; because on the previous evening they had found
their bright fireside so delightful that they had remained
there billing and cooing like a pair of lovers, as they still
were, until the small hours, when at length they went to
rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was the first of the two to rise in the morning; for
she was an ardent little housewife, and she liked to have
everything about her small home in perfect order.</p>

<p class='c011'>He slept on until noon, and then awoke with a weight
upon his mind, though a very vague idea of what it meant.
But presently, as his brain grew clearer, he remembered all
the perplexing events of the preceding day and cursed his
fate for bringing him into such an embarrassing position.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he made his morning toilet he reflected that his uncle,
an “early bird,” like most old country gentlemen, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>probably some hours before this called at his room at the
Blank House and found him absent, and perhaps had been
told by the servants there that he had not been in all night.</p>

<p class='c011'>What could the old gentleman think of such irregularity
on the part of his nephew and intended son-in-law?</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander scarcely dared to answer that question. But
full of anxious and perplexing thoughts, he finished his
toilet and went below stairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the breakfast room he found a fine fire, a neat table,
and his lovely young wife in her pretty morning dress of
white merino with black trimmings.</p>

<p class='c011'>She put aside the book she had been reading and arose
to receive him. He kissed her in silence and then dropped
heavily into his chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>She rang the bell and ordered breakfast served.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope you have not waited for me, dear?” he languidly
remarked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I had a cup of tea and a bit of dry toast when
I first came down; but that was nine o’clock, and it is
after one now; so I am quite ready to take breakfast
with you. It will be my lunch.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Fragrant Mocha coffee, fresh eggs, smoked salmon,
broiled chicken and light muffins were soon placed upon
the table; and the two sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>But tempting as the viands were that stood, before him,
Alexander could eat but little.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla noticed his want of appetite and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not well, dear. Have you a head-ache? Shall
I order some strong green tea made for you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Drusa; I never drink tea in the morning unless I
am really sick. And I am quite well now; except that I
am a little disturbed in regard to—to that business connected
with my late father’s will,” said Alexander, evasively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, then it wasn’t settled yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no; and I fear it will not be for many days yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“I am sorry, Alick. But never mind. Everybody must
have some little thing to vex them; but it can’t last forever,
you know. Try a little bit of this smoked salmon. It is
very nice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To please her he tried the salmon, and found that it gave
him an appetite; and he made a better breakfast than he
had expected to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he had finished, he rang the bell, which summoned
Leo to the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have my horse saddled and brought around here directly,”
he said to the boy. Then, turning to his wife, he
added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall have to ride into town to-day to look after that
business; but I will try to be back before night. I hope
you won’t be very lonesome, dear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>An involuntary expression of surprise and disappointment
clouded her face for an instant; but she chased the
clouds away, and smilingly replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, I shall be very busy. But if you will tell me
at what hour you will be back, I will have dinner ready for
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have dinner at the usual hour, my dear. I will be
back in time for it if I possibly can. But do not wait for
me beyond five o’clock, do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Alick,” she answered, and again she had to chase
away a rising cloud of disappointment by a sunny smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went out to prepare for his ride, and as soon as he
was ready he kissed his young wife and begged her not to
mope; and then he mounted his horse, that stood saddled
at the door, and rode briskly away.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked after him until he was out of sight, and then
with a sigh turned into the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Alexander rode rapidly into the city, and,
after leaving his horse at the livery stable, hurried anxiously
off to the hotel where his uncle and cousin were stopping,
and sent up his card.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>They were both in, and he was soon ushered up into their
private sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon, reclining in his resting chair, was reading
the morning papers; and Miss Lyon, lolling on the sofa,
was turning over the leaves of the libretto of the opera of
the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander felt a little guilty as he walked into their
presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he was instantly consoled and reassured by the
manners of both old gentleman and young lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, is that you, Alick? Good morning. Sit down.
Excuse me for not rising. This is a shocking version of
Il Trovatore,” said Anna, without moving, or lifting her
eyes from the pages she was studying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! how do you do? Glad to see you. Intended to
walk around your way this morning and see how you were
getting on. But really, in such sharp weather as this, it
seems to require an effort to leave the chimney corner.
Hope you’ll excuse my not calling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With all my heart, sir,” said Alexander, feeling immensely
relieved, and blessing his stars that his uncle had
not called on him and discovered his absence after all.
“With all my heart, sir! I could not indeed expect, and
would not wish you to take the trouble. It is rather my
duty always to wait upon you—a duty that I shall always
be most happy to perform.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re a good lad, Alick, a good lad,” said the old
soldier, frankly holding out his hand to his nephew.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope I shall always be so happy as to deserve your
good opinion, sir,” said Alexander, taking the offered hand
and bowing deeply over it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as he lifted himself up again he encountered the
laughing eyes of Anna, who was regarding him with a
mocking smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, really, Alick, you know you are growing so Joseph
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Surfacish, that I am beginning to doubt your sincerity,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander’s countenance fell. But the old gentleman
came to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind her, Alick. Who ever does mind Anna?
But listen to me. I have made an engagement for you this
evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander started, with an unpleasant sensation about his
heart; but the old gentleman, without noticing him, went
on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There have been several parties calling here this morning,
to invite Anna to go and hear this celebrated Italian
Opera Troupe. But I excused her to one and all, telling
them she was engaged to go with you, and also giving them
to understand that she was also engaged for life to you, so
that they might not waste any attentions upon her. And
I sent and took a private box for you both, for this evening.
Come! no thanks. I don’t desire any. It was perfectly
convenient for me to make these arrangements, to save you
the trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander was dumb-foundered; he could not have
returned thanks if he had tried. He dropped into the nearest
seat, and wiped his face with his handkerchief, while the
old gentleman went on to describe the attractions of the Italian
Opera, and while Anna silently, with an amused expression
of countenance, watched both.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I fear, sir, that I cannot have the honor intended
for me. I—”</p>

<p class='c011'>—“Cannot have the honor intended for you? What the
mischief do you mean by that, sir?” demanded the old
gentleman, in surprise and displeasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A previous engagement, I regret to say, sir, stands in
the way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What sort of an engagement, boy? What sort of an
engagement?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“I had promised to dine with a friend—” began Alexander,
speaking truly as to the letter, and falsely as to the
spirit. But the old gentleman stopped him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, a friend! a gentleman, of course, for it isn’t possible
that you should have promised to dine with any lady.
Bosh, boy! Send the man an excuse; tell him here is a
lady in the case; and take an early dinner with us, and be
ready to attend Anna.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Really, my dear grandfather, I wish you would not
press this matter upon Mr. Lyon. You know that Dick is
most anxious to be my escort,” said Miss Lyon, in very justifiable
displeasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lyon and Dick. She called Alexander “Mr. Lyon,”
and Richard Hammond “Dick.” Alexander noticed the
distinction, and his blood fired; but before he could say a
word, the old gentleman, with a flushed brow, struck in:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick? What the deuce do you mean, Anna? Do
you suppose I am going to allow you to be gallanted about
by Dick or any other man, for that matter, to set people
gossipping? You an engaged young lady! And you,
sir!” he exclaimed, turning angrily to Alexander—“Thunder
and lightning! what do <i>you</i> mean, sir, by your
excuses and your hesitations? Do you mean to slight your
betrothed, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven forbid!” answered Alexander, earnestly. “I
told you the reason why I hesitated—that I had an engagement
to dinner, but that engagement—every lighter
engagement—shall give way to your will, sir, and my dear
cousin’s service.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so saying he bowed to his uncle, and would have
lifted his cousin’s hand to his lips, but that she drew it
away with a mocking smile as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks, Mr. ‘Joseph Surface.’ As I am resolved to
see the opera, and as I cannot do so without your escort, I
suppose I must accept it. Though I tell you plainly that
I would much rather have Dick’s company.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Anna!” exclaimed the general, again breaking in
before Alexander could reply; “Anna, this is unbearable!
to tell your betrothed husband that you would rather have
another man’s company than his!—But Alick, my boy, I
must say that you brought it all on yourself by your tardiness
and seeming indifference.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very sorry if I have seemed to be indifferent,
when in fact I was very far from <i>really</i> being so. I hope
my dear cousin will forgive me,” bowed Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, of course she will. She spoke only from petulance—nothing
else,” smiled the old gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Anna said nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this most unpropitious moment Mr. Richard Hammond
was announced and entered the room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

      <div class='line'>And he was jealous, tho’ he would not show it,</div>
      <div class='line'>For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.—<span class='sc'>Byron.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For an instant the rivals glared at each other; and then
remembering in whose presence they stood, they lowered
their eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Richard Hammond shook hands with his uncle and his
Cousin Anna and then turned towards Alexander, and the
kindness of his heart overcoming all his jealousy for the
moment, he frankly held out his hand, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you do, Alick? I hope you are well!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks, quite so,” returned Lyon, stiffly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The general, a frank-hearted old soldier, did not like the
reception that Alick had given Dick. He thought the successful
rival, the accepted lover, the promised husband,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>might well afford to be more generous; and so to make up
to Richard for the coldness of Alexander, he turned to the
former and clapping him on the shoulder, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, my boy! what are you standing there for? Sit
down! sit down! and make yourself at home. Stay and
dine with us. We shall be quite a family party!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick laughed, thanked his uncle and took the offered
seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>And really soon his presence seemed to be a godsend to
the constrained party. His gay, good-humored manner
and conversation soon raised the spirits and warmed the
hearts of all the little group. Even Alexander had the
grace to come out of his sulks, and to say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must congratulate you, Dick, upon your accession to a
large fortune.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Alick. It came in good time, I tell you
that. But Lord, Alick, maybe after all this fortune is only
so much more steam clapped on the engine with which the
demon is driving me on the road to ruin!” said Dick, with
his usual outspoken truthfulness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope not; I hope not,” said Alick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I <i>believe</i> not,” put in the general. “I am very
glad to know that my nephew Dick has given up all his
wild companions, who having spent one fortune for him,
would be very glad to spend another.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ran away from them, uncle, ran away from them. I
hadn’t courage to give them up, so I gave them ‘leg bail’
and left them all behind in Richmond.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Right my boy! right! whatever may be said of the
heroism of braving bodily perils, it is much wiser to run
away from moral danger than to face it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick cannot bear to give any one pain. And if he had
stayed among his old associates in Richmond, he would have
let them ruin him again, rather than he would have hurt
their feelings by cutting their acquaintance,” explained
Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“Exactly. Therefore I say it was wiser to run away, as
it will also be wisest to stay away,” said the general.
“But here comes the waiter to lay the cloth for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They all dined together; and afterwards, as there seemed
scarcely any way of eluding the engagement, Alick took
Anna to the Opera.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed really discourteous, as Alexander had a whole
private box to himself and Anna, that he would not invite
Dick to take a seat in it; but in fact he could not bring
himself to do such violence to his own feelings of rivalry.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick went to the opera, however; and he occupied an
orchestra chair in a much better position for seeing and
hearing than was Alexander’s and Anna’s private box.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when the curtain fell upon the first act, he came
around to the box, without seeming to think that he was
intruding, and gayly and good-humoredly talked and
laughed with his cousins, until the curtain rose upon the
second act. And in the intervals of all the succeeding acts
he came round to their box. Though there were two vacant
seats, Alexander never once invited him to take one of
them. Anna always did, however, and pressed him
cordially to sit down. But Dick always gayly declined, and
merely leaning over the back of one of the unoccupied
chairs, talked and laughed until the rising of the curtain
warned him to make his bow and retreat.</p>

<p class='c011'>The performance was a very long one, so that it was
some time after twelve o’clock when Alexander took Anna
back to the hotel and gave her up to the charge of her
grandfather.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was after two o’clock, when, half frozen and half
famished, worn out in body and harassed in mind, he
reached his home.</p>

<p class='c011'>As on the evening previous the lights from the little
drawing-room windows, gleaming through the wintry
woods, cheered him on his approach and warned him that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>his loving wife was still up and waiting to welcome him
home.</p>

<p class='c011'>And there he found a bright fire, a warm supper and a
happy face to comfort him. As before she forbore to
reproach or to question him, and she received his voluntary
explanation without hesitation and without doubt;—but
this explanation, while true to the letter as far as it went,
was false in the spirit—giving her the impression that still
“the troublesome business connected with his father’s will”
detained him in town.</p>

<p class='c011'>Much of his conversation now, while being true to the
letter, was false in the spirit. But how could this possibly
be expected to last?</p>

<p class='c011'>Day after day Alexander rode in to town. Night after
night he came back, never earlier than one o’clock, sometimes
as late as three or four; for on these occasions he
would have to escort his cousin to a ball where the festivities
were kept up until near daylight. And though Anna
being in half mourning refrained from dancing, she seldom
retired from the scene until one or two o’clock.</p>

<p class='c011'>For many days and nights Drusilla bore this state of
things with exceeding patience and cheerfulness; always
accepting his excuses for leaving her in the morning, and
always having the lighted windows, the warm drawing-room,
the bright fire and the hot supper to welcome him at
night. But ah! worship him as she would, she was but a
soul encased in flesh and blood, and her health and spirits
from loneliness and late hours, long continued, began to
suffer. There was another cause, too, for the poor child’s
failing strength, which had her husband known it, should
have appealed strongly to his tenderness. But to do him
justice in this particular, he did not know it any more than
his wife did. She became nervous and irritable, and she
wondered what could ail her, to make her so unlike her old
self. She tried very hard first to overcome her nervous
irritability, then to keep it from annoying him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>After he would leave her each day she would begin to
occupy herself diligently, so that her spirits might not
droop. She inspected every portion of her house from roof
to cellar, and kept all in perfect order. She did a great
deal of needle-work, she read many books, she painted some
pictures, and she perfected herself in some of the most
difficult pieces of music. So at first she managed to get
through her lonely days.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the day’s work was done, and the sky grew dark,
and she knew that a long, lonely night was before her, she
would have a bright fire lighted in the drawing-room and
an exquisite little supper planned out for her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then, when bed time came, in her kindness of heart
she would send her servants to rest, and she would sit alone
by the fire, reading and watching until his return. Sometimes,
in the loneliness of the place, and of the hour, the
stillness would grow almost awful to her, and she would feel
that she must speak to some human creature, or go mad, and
she would be tempted to go and call Pina up to sit with her.
But there again her compassion came in and saved her
servant from being disturbed. And so, rather than inconvenience
another, she would sit on alone “through the
dead waste and middle of the night,” until she became so
nervous as to dread to hear the sound of her own low breathing,
or to see the reflection of her own scared face in the
glass.</p>

<p class='c011'>But then how welcome the sound of his horse’s feet, which
her listening ears could hear in the deep silence even when
he was riding along the open road before he turned into the
wood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then in a moment all was changed. The flush of joy
chased the paleness from her cheeks; the light of love
beamed from her eye; and she was ready to welcome him
with her happy face.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One morning near the last of February, when the young
wife arose, leaving her husband still in bed heavily sleeping
off his fatigue, she found that it was snowing fast, the flakes
coming down fine and thick as sifted flour, and promising a
deep and heavy fall. And she was glad to see it, for she
said to herself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely Alick cannot leave home on such a tempestuous
day as this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And if it had been possible for her fireside and breakfast
table to have been brighter and more attractive than
they always were, she would have made them so this morning
for his sake. And the hope, the almost certainty of
having him home all day long made her face radiant with
joy and beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently he came down heavily enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What beastly weather!” he said, looking through the
window at the thickly falling snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her face fell a little, she scarcely knew why. But she
touched the bell and ordered the breakfast served.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And tell Leo to have my horse at the door in half an
hour,” added Alick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not going out on such a day as this, dear
Alick,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I am. It is that horrid business. Now, Drusilla,
my little woman, do try to be cheerful and don’t vex me by
looking that way,” he said, as he saw her grave face.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>“I am only sorry, dear, that you have to leave home in
such weather, that is all,” she answered, as she turned and
busied herself with pouring out the coffee that was just
then set upon the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he ate his breakfast in haste, dressed in haste and
then mounted his horse and hurried off to town.</p>

<p class='c011'>The snow continued to fall and the day passed very
heavily with the poor young wife. Still her thought was
for her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what a night he will have to come home in,” she
said to herself again and again, as she saw that the weather
grew worse and worse as the day waned later and later.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length towards evening she could keep her anxiety
to herself no longer, and she said to her maid:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Pina, what a night for Mr. Lyon to ride home in!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, ma’am, I don’t think he will come at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not come home at all!” echoed Pina’s mistress,
aghast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why you see, ma’am, it will be dangerous. Only look
out. The fences are nearly all covered and the snow is still
falling,” said the girl, pointing through the windows of the
kitchen where this conversation took place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see,” sighed the lonely wife, and her heart seemed to
sink like lead in her bosom. But then she took herself to
task and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why should I feel so miserable because my husband
must stay away from me for one night? I would much
rather that he should stay all night in Washington than
risk his life in attempting to return home in the darkness,
through such a snow-storm as this, in which all landmarks
seem to be lost.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so she tried to reason with her longing heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>At night, however, it stopped snowing. But the wind
came up from the northwest and blew very hard, and the
new fallen snow began to freeze as firm as adamant.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“What do you think now, Pina? Do you think your
master can get home?” inquired the master’s wife of her
maid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor, ma’am, why this is worse than the other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is, Pina?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This freeze is worse than the falling snow, ma’am;
because it will make the roads all as slippery as glass; so,
even if his horse is rough shod, master will hardly be able
to get home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Pina, I trust that he will run no risk. But, in
case he should come, we must have everything ready for
him as usual. The worse the weather, the more comfort he
will want. So you must dress the wild duck for the roaster,
and I will make a little cabinet pudding,” said Pina’s mistress,
tying on an apron and tucking up her sleeves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We may prepare for him, ma’am, but he will never
return such a night as this, you may take my word for that.
It would be as much as his life and limbs are worth to
attempt it,” answered the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>These words made the young wife very uneasy. Much
as she wished for his presence, she now prayed that he
might not set out to return. And it was with some comfort
she reflected that Alexander never unnecessarily ran
any risk; that he would certainly be able to judge of the
dangers of the roads, and would as certainly avoid them.
Still, in the event of his returning that night, she was
determined to have everything ready for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>As night deepened, it grew colder and colder. Outside
it was like the polar regions. There</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dread winter spread his latest glooms</div>
      <div class='line'>And reigned tremendous—”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>—all darkness, snow and ice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Inside, all was light, warmth and comfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the drawing-room a large bright fire was burning;
the little table was laid for supper; the easy chair and the
warm slippers were ready.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>At ten o’clock, Drusilla, as usual, would have dismissed
her maid to bed, but the girl pleaded to remain up “for
this once” with her mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, ma’am, master will not be home to-night,
I’m certain sure of it. But you’ll sit up all the same. So
please let me sit up with you till you gives it up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As you like, Pina,” replied the young mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the little lady settled herself in one of the easy
chairs before the fire, and the maid nestled down among
the foot cushions in the corner.</p>

<p class='c011'>In less than an hour, Pina, overcome with the heat of
the fire and the heaviness of her own head, fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla watched on, almost as much alone as if her
maid had been a hundred miles away—as very likely she
was, in the spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla was hoping against hope, that her too much
loved husband might return home and in safety; but she
could not justify this hope to her reason, for certainly this
was a night in which no man in his senses, who valued his
life and limbs, would take the road; and just as certainly,
Alexander had a wholsome regard for his own; so it was
not likely that he would risk them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still, Drusilla waited and watched until the clock struck
twelve. Then, as her maid was snoring sonorously, to say
nothing of baking her head by getting it almost into the
fire, Drusilla woke her up and ordered her off to bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina, too utterly wearied with watching, and too stupid
with sleep to make any resistance, stumbled off to her attic,
finding her way as a somnambulist might.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla was left quite alone. The clock struck
two. And still she watched on and on. She thought there
was little use in doing so, but she could not help it. She
continued, at intervals, to stare through the windows, and
to listen to every sound without, though she saw nothing
but the darkness of the night, and the glimmer of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>snow-clad, spectral looking trees, and heard nothing but the
howling of the wind and the rattling of the icicles.</p>

<p class='c011'>But suddenly, through all deeper sounds, she heard the
merry ringing of sleigh-bells!</p>

<p class='c011'>And she started to her feet, for she knew in an instant,
that her husband had come home in a sleigh—a possibility
that had never occurred either to herself or her servant.</p>

<p class='c011'>She ran to the door and pulled it open. But Alexander
had turned around to the stable, and so it was some ten
minutes before he returned to the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>It flew open at his knock, and Drusilla threw herself in
his arms; she could not help this, she was so overjoyed at
his almost unhoped for return in safety that night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Up still, my faithful little darling?” he said, kissing
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; and I hope you are very hungry this time, as well
as very cold, dear Alick, for I have such a supper for you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes? Well you may swear that I am famished, for I
have not broken my fast since luncheon,” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>She helped him to draw off his overcoat, and hung it up
in the hall; and then she pulled him with affectionate solicitude
and playful force out from the cold hall into the snug
little drawing-room, and made him comfortable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Alick, your hands are almost frozen! You must
have had a real Laplander’s ride, and without the Laplander’s
furs. How came you to undertake it, dear?” she
asked, as she pushed him down in his arm-chair, and sat on
a cushion at his side, and took his icy hands between her
own warm ones, and rubbed them. “Why did you come,
Alick, dear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My darling, it is bad enough for me to stay away from
you as much as I do—as much as I am <i>compelled</i> to do on
account of that vexatious business; but really it would be
too bad to stay away all night, and I never mean to do
that,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“Oh, Alick dear, how glad I am to hear you say so.
And I am so glad you came to-night, since you have
reached home in safety. The servants thought that you
would not come, that it would be too dangerous a journey to
undertake on horseback.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So it would, my dear, and that is the reason why I
bought the sleigh; which, besides, I thought would be useful
this winter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, indeed, so it will. And we are both so fond
of sleighing. We shall have some fine sleighing together,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>He made no reply to the observation, for he knew full
well that he should have no time to realize her anticipations.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you remember, Alick, the fine sleigh rides we
used to have in the Christmas holidays, when you used to
come home to spend them; and when you used to take
Miss Anna out, and always insist that your ‘child,’ as you
called me, should go along, too? Do you remember,
Alick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, little Drusa, quite well,” he answered gravely,
and with some emotion, as he tenderly smoothed her hair
with his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, can I ever forget all your kindness to me from that
time to the very present? Can I ever do too much—can I
ever do enough for you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor little Drusa!” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But there, your hands are warm now, and I will set the
supper on the table,” said the busy little housewife.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Alick was warmed and fed, and comforted and
satisfied, he turned from the table and the fire towards his
little wife, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Drusa, as I had the sleigh I thought I might as
well bring something home in it besides myself. So I
walked into several of the book stores and picked up the
best of the new books that are published.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“New books! Oh, thank you, dear Alick; where are
they?” eagerly exclaimed Drusilla, rising from her chair to
look for them; for she who had so few amusements—so
few?—I should have said no amusements at all,—was
delighted at the mention of new books. “Where are they,
Alick dear?” she repeated, glancing around the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sit down, my pet. Do you think I could have brought
them in my hand, or in my pocket? Why, they are an
armful for a railway porter. I left them in the sleigh in
the stable. You shall have a glorious time over them to-morrow;
it is too late to look at them to-night even if we
had them lying before us; for, do you see what o’clock it
is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla glanced up at the Ormolu time-piece on the
mantle shelf, and saw, with surprise, that it was nearly two
o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Alexander arose at the same moment to put up the
guard and close the shutters, saying, with a smile,</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have to be our own servants when we are so unreasonable
as to sit up so late, love.” And soon after both
retired.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day was intensely cold, but clear and brilliant;
the ground was covered deep with hard frozen snow, and
the trees were clothed with frost and ice, and the sun
shone out of a bright blue sky, lighting up all the scene
with blinding radiance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately after breakfast, Mr. Lyon had the sleigh
brought around to the door. The packages, left in it from
the night before, were ordered to be taken out and brought
into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, little one! here are some dozens of new books
that will help you to kill the time between this and my
return,” said Alexander, directing her attention to the
packages.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you, Alick. But must you go to town again
to-day?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Of course I must; I must go every day for some time
yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla suppressed the sigh that arose to her lips, but
she could not forbear the question:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And stay late, Alick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is as it may be, Drusa. I shall return as soon as
I can get away. Now amuse yourself with your books,
and don’t mope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, I won’t mope,” said Drusilla. “You are so
good to me, Alick, I ought not to do so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He jumped into his sleigh, and sped away to the ringing
of the bells. And she watched him out of sight, and then
turned into the drawing-room and sat down among her new
books, and began to unwrap them. Most of my readers
know the delight of opening and examining a package of
new books. Drusilla was absorbed in the pleasure of opening
package after package, and examining volume after
volume, until at length she selected the book that she wished
to read first, and laid it aside, and then she took the others
into the library and put them in proper places.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had scarcely completed this pleasant piece of work,
before she heard her maid calling to her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ma’am, ma’am, come here, please, and see the snow-birds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She who loved all living creatures, went into the kitchen
and looked from the windows, and saw hopping about upon
the frozen snow several hundred of these little creatures.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, who had always spent her summers in the
country, but her winters in town, had never seen, or, if she
had seen, had never particularly noticed, these birds before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My! what a sight! What brings so many of them
here, Pina?” she inquired, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you see, ma’am, the ground and the bushes and
the trees are all covered with frost and snow and ice, and
they can’t find anything to eat in the woods or fields or
lanes, and so they look for food about houses.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“Poor little things! What do they eat, Pina?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anything eatable, ma’am, that is small enough for them
to swallow;—grains of rice, crumbs of bread, specks of
meat——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, throw out whole handfuls of rice for them,” said
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That would hardly do, ma’am. It would sink in the
snow and be lost before the birds could get it. But if you
will let me sprinkle food on all the window-sills around the
house, you will see the little creatures come in scores to eat.
And it will amuse you, like, ma’am, to sit and see the art
of the little rogues, how one will watch from a bush to see
the coast clear, and then notify the others to come and
eat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, then,” said Drusilla, with all the eagerness of a
child, “crumble up several loaves of bread, and sprinkle
every window-sill of the house full as it will hold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you like some traps set in the woods, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Traps, what for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To catch the birds, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To catch the birds?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am. They make excellent pies, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, hush—no!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The boys will catch them, ma’am, if you don’t. They
set traps in the woods. And they puts food under them.
And the little birds go to get it, and are caught and
killed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How cruel and treacherous! Poor little things, to be
frozen out, and starved out, and to come to us for food and
shelter, and to be killed and eaten. The boys shan’t trap
them on our place, any way. So if you or Leo find a trap
in our woods break it up, and if you find a trapper whip
him!” said the little champion of birds, as she left the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>That day passed with Drusilla less drearily than usual.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>When all her household duties had been discharged, she
sat in her snug little drawing-room, feasting upon her new
books, and furtively watching the snow-birds that were
feasting upon the crumbs on the window-sill, and which as
furtively watched her, and flew away the instant they
caught her eyes, only to fly back the instant they saw them
fall upon her book again; for these little raiders did not yet
know their benefactress.</p>

<p class='c011'>So quiet was this place that the wild creatures of the
woods feared not to approach it; and Drusilla, looking
from her window, could see the squirrel seated on a twig
and nibbling his nut, or the opossum curled up in his hole,
or the fleet little hare race across the frozen snow, or the
raccoon peeping from the hollow of his tree. It was well
that this child of nature loved nature with all her children
so well, for not a human being could Drusilla see from her
window.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her beautiful wild wood home—beautiful even in the
dead of winter—was separated on all sides by many acres
of thick woods from any public thoroughfare. The road
leading through the woods was a strictly private one leading
to her house, and nowhere else.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla sat alternately reading and watching her favorites,
until two o’clock in the afternoon, when Pina brought
in her mistress’s simple dinner of boiled chicken and custard
pudding.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a solitary dinner; for things had come to such a
pass now that the little wife, instead of taking a luncheon
in the middle of the day, and waiting dinner for the husband
who never, never came to eat it, always now dined
alone soon after noon.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now Drusilla consoled herself for the absence of her
husband by thinking of the supper she would prepare for
him and share with him in the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pina,” she said, as she saw the snow-birds fly away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>from the window-sill at her slightest motion; “Pina, will I
never be able to tame these little creatures by kindness?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, ma’am; you may make them so tame that
they will come and eat out of your hand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How—how can I do that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By just doing as you do now, ma’am. They will soon
find out as you mean them no harm but good, and they will
cease to fear you and begin to love you,” answered the girl,
as she removed the dinner service.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla spent the afternoon as she had spent the
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>That night Alexander, for a wonder, came home as early
as eight o’clock. And the cheerful day was succeeded by
a happy evening.</p>

<p class='c006'>Alexander had his troubles too, and they were not the
less trying because he had brought them on himself by his
own wrong-doing—rather the more so, in fact, since remorse
was added to regret, and the loss of self-respect to the loss
of domestic peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was learning by personal experience that “the way of
the transgressor is hard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He found it very difficult to play two parts and live in
two places at the same time.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the way his day passed. He usually arose at
ten o’clock in the morning, with a bad head-ache and a
worse heart-ache, made a quick toilet and a poor breakfast,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>then threw himself into the saddle and rode away as fast as
his horse’s feet could carry him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He always contrived to be at his rooms in his hotel by
eleven o’clock in the forenoon, lest his uncle should call for
him and find him out. And always on entering his chamber
he would tumble his bed and slop his wash-stand to deceive
the servants of the hotel into the idea that he had
slept there; for he was in constant dread lest his uncle
should discover that he passed the night elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>To carry on the deception, every day he breakfasted at
the hotel table, and he dined with his uncle and cousin.
And every evening he accompanied Anna to some place of
amusement, where she was always the most admired beauty
in the room, and where he was the most envied man, because
it was generally understood that he was her betrothed
husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>He seldom returned home before one o’clock, and sometimes
not before three in the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>You perceive by this how little time he had to bestow on
his young wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Drusilla was more lonely than words can tell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just think of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the depth of winter.</p>

<p class='c011'>She lived in a lone house in a thick wood. She had no
companion in the house, no acquaintance in the neighborhood,
and no correspondent in the world. She never made
a visit, or had a visitor, or wrote a letter, or received one.
Her one object in life was her husband; her one interest in
the day his return at night; and if he had given her a
little more of his company, if only an evening now and
then, she could have been happy;—or if, when he did come
home, he could have been more cheerful in her presence, she
would have been less miserable.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, ah! friends, Alexander—as is always the case with
an evil-doer—went on from bad to worse.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>And when morning after morning he gulped down his
coffee in hot haste, and hurried away from his home, in
eager anxiety; and when night after night he returned in
the small hours, too cold, tired and harassed to notice the
preparations she had made for his comfort, or to share the
supper she had kept waiting for him, or even to bestow a
kiss or a smile, or a look upon her; when, in fact, he
seemed to have become estranged from her; then, indeed,
her heart failed, her beauty faded, and she hung her head
like a flower drooping in the cold.</p>

<p class='c011'>She tried very hard to keep up her spirits and preserve
her beauty for his sake and for her own. For more than all
earthly things she wished to retain his love. And she
remembered how in her childhood, he had scolded her for
crying, telling her that it made her ugly, and that he could
not possibly love an ugly little girl; and how she had
almost suffocated herself then, in her efforts to suppress her
sobs, lest she should grow ugly and lose his love.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he had been a mere thoughtless youth, teasing a
timid child who loved him; now he was or seemed a
heartless man, torturing a sensitive young woman, who had
given her whole life into his hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet these were not her thoughts of him; she did not
blame him even to herself; she was more ingenious in finding
excuses for his conduct, than even he would have been.
But she was right in trying to be always bright and beautiful,
so as to retain his love, since she valued it so highly—for
he <i>did</i> dislike ugly and sorrowful faces.</p>

<p class='c011'>And at length, when her powers of self-control were exhausted—when
loneliness, late hours, fatigue of body and
distress of mind had done their work upon her heart and
frame, and broken down her health and spirits—her pale
face, heavy eyes, languid motions and faltering tones irritated
him, for they were so many severe, though silent and
involuntary reproaches to him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“As if it were not enough,” he sometimes said to himself,
“that for her sake, I have foolishly given up the most
beautiful woman of the day, and sacrificed the most brilliant
prospects of my life, and worse than all, placed myself in a
false and degrading position, but that now, she must make
me more miserable still, with her moping manners.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But here his faithful conscience always rebuked him for
his injustice, and awakened his memory to remind him,
that his poor young wife herself, child as she was, had at
the time of his proposal for her hand, set all these possible
regrets before him, and had warned him to pause and
reflect, before taking the irrevocable step of making her his
wife; and that he himself had been strong to overcome her
hesitation and stubborn to maintain his own will.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then in a fit of remorse, he would break out upon
himself with:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am certainly the most infernal villain that Heaven
ever let live!” or words to the same effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>In these moods he would go and buy something to take
home to Drusilla, some set of jewels, piece of lace, rich
shawl, gay dress, or other article of vanity.</p>

<p class='c011'>But soon he saw that his child bride, who was still wearing
her first mourning for her dead mother, valued these
things not in themselves, but only as proofs of his thought
for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>And besides, how could jewels and fine clothes console
the loving young wife for the lost society of her husband?</p>

<p class='c011'>But Alexander was provoked, that his efforts to please
her were so utterly unavailing. He did not reflect that if
she had been a vain, selfish woman, and had loved herself
more than she loved him, she would have been happy in his
<i>presents</i>, and indifferent to his <i>presence</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as she was neither vain, nor selfish, as she loved him
rather than herself, she pined amidst all her plenty, because
he was almost always absent from her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>This pining became evident in her appearance, notwithstanding
all her efforts to conceal it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And sometimes it exasperated him so much that it was
with difficulty he could restrain himself from reproaching
her, and thus adding to the sum of his own injustice and
her misery.</p>

<p class='c011'>Often, also, his temper was severely tried in town by
what <i>he</i> called the difficulties of his position, but what any
one else might have called the hardships of the transgressor.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day especially, when he rode into the city a little
later than usual, he found his uncle at his room waiting for
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where the deuce is it, Alick, that you gallop off to
every morning of your life?” inquired the old gentleman,
who had somehow or other got a hint that his nephew rode
<i>into</i> Washington every morning, but had no suspicion that
he slept <i>out</i> of the city every night. “Where the deuce is
it that you go?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alick, taken by surprise, hesitated before he could summon
the presence of his mind, and reply:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I make a practice of taking a gallop through the
morning air for my health.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Umph, umph, umph!” growled the old gentleman.
“You look more like you made a practice of sitting over
your wine until four or five, or six o’clock in the morning,
for your illness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alick laughed rather lugubriously, it must be confessed,
for he saw that the old gentleman’s suspicions were aroused,
although, of course, they must have been of the vaguest
character.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said the general, “you have got a busy day
before you, Alick, and no time to lose. First, you have to
escort Anna to St. John’s Church, to be present at the
wedding of Senor Don Emillio Arayo, the son of the Brazilian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Minister, with Mademoiselle Marie de Courcey, niece
of the French Ambassador. All the world is going, and
Anna is going with them, of course.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Satan fly away with the Spanish puppy and the French
ninny!” was Alick’s secret thought. But he bowed, and
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, I shall be most happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then you are engaged to dine at Major General
Scott’s. And after that to go and take Anna, to see the
great new tragedienne, Mrs. Starrs, in Lady Macbeth;
after which you sup with me and Anna.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a fussy old Polonius uncle is getting to be, to be
sure! I really think the old man is falling into his
dotage,” thought Alick within himself. But he answered
aloud:</p>

<p class='c011'>“A very pleasant programme, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, I suppose you young people think it so. I confess
I don’t. But, Alick, my boy, I must beg you to forego
your gallop to-morrow morning. My old friend—and your
late father’s oldest friend—Commodore Storms, is coming to
breakfast with me at eight o’clock, and, of course, you must
join us. It will be the only chance you will have of seeing
him, as he is only passing through the city on his way
south, and leaves by the mid-day train to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander stared in dismay, and then inquired:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could I not see him to-day, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, he is gone with a party to visit Mount Vernon.
Besides, what time have you to do any thing to-day but
what is appointed for you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“None indeed,” said Alexander with an involuntary sigh,
which did not escape the notice of the old man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does it afflict you so much then?” enquired the general.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The idea of your giving up your mysterious morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>ride for a breakfast with two old Revolutionary relics like
the commodore and myself,” answered the general, fixing a
scrutinizing gaze upon his nephew’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh no, sir! I—was thinking only how much rather I
would see my father’s old friend sooner than later,” answered
Alexander, again true in the letter but false in the spirit
of his reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so Mr. Lyon concluded that there was no alternative
for him but to stay in town all night as well as all day.
And he did so, fully carrying out the programme sketched
for him by his uncle, but feeling all the while great pain
from the thought that his poor lonely young wife would sit
up the whole night waiting anxiously for his return.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day was quite as much taken up with engagements
as any former day had been; and so it was long past
midnight when Alick got home.</p>

<p class='c011'>He found Drusilla wan and wasted with waiting and
watching there two days and nights of suspense and anxiety;
but he saw no look of reproach in her gentle eyes,
heard no word of blame from her sweet lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>He perceived her sufferings and was angry with himself
for causing them, and he began some lame explanation of
his absence.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she saw his embarrassment and stopped his faltering
words with a kiss, and she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Alick, it is enough that you are here again to
make me happy. You do not need to render your poor
little wife, who has not much wisdom of her own, an account
of your actions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she told him the little news of the two days at home,
and she laughed and jested and served his supper with her
old cheerfulness and alacrity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning Alexander went to town with the
deliberate purpose of ending his own perplexities and his
wife’s sufferings, by doing the right thing and confessing
his secret marriage, to his uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>But ah! it always happened whenever an especial fit of
repentance moved Alexander to amendment, something
occurred to throw him back upon his evil course and confirm
him in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>So it was on this morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>He strolled into a reading-room and sat down at one of
the tables and took up a paper to look at the news of the
day. He had not been there more than five minutes when
he heard his cousin Anna’s name mentioned in connection
with his own. Impulsively he looked up and listened.</p>

<p class='c011'>The speakers, seated at a table near, were strangers to
him, as he evidently was to them, since they discussed his
private affairs so freely in his hearing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you there is not a word of truth in it. It is all a
mistake. It is a false report. The beautiful Anna cares no
more for young Lyon than she does for you or me. If she
cares for any one on earth, it is for that handsome fellow,
Dick Hammond, who has just come into a great fortune,”
said the first speaker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That may all be quite true. I am not saying who she
cares for, but who she is going to marry. She may not
care a pin for Lyon, and she may adore Hammond; but for
all that she must marry Lyon and give Hammond the goby,
since such was the will of the two ancient landed proprietors,
her grandfather and granduncle, who long ago
decided that their large estates should be united,” said the
second speaker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if I were the lady’s choice, Dick Hammond, I
think I should set a very serious impediment between the
union of those said estates.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if I were the betrothed lover, Alexander Lyon, I
would break Dick’s neck for his presumption,” said the last
speaker, as both arose from the table and strolled away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander’s anger and jealousy were both aroused, and
his good resolutions were put to flight. He arose and followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>the two speakers, but they had disappeared in the
crowd.</p>

<p class='c011'>The days of duelling are past, thank Heaven; else Alexander
would have liked to have sought out and called out
one or both of these male gossips and exchanged a shot
with either or both of them at ten paces.</p>

<p class='c011'>As it was he could only let his anger cool down and then
acknowledge to himself that they had really neither done
nor said anything very wrong. They had only unconsciously
wounded his self-love and aroused his jealousy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna Lyon, his beautiful cousin, had always been intended
for himself, he said, and Dick Hammond knew it.
And even now, for all Dick Hammond knew to the contrary,
he, Alick Lyon, had the exclusive right to Anna’s
regards.</p>

<p class='c011'>How then did he, Dick Hammond, dare to set himself
up as a lover of Anna, and a rival of her betrothed?</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes! and how dared Anna, in the face of her parent’s
will and her own engagements, receive and favor him as
such?</p>

<p class='c011'>Alick ground his teeth with rage and jealousy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They must never know, they <i>shall</i> never know, but
that my claims to Anna’s hand are as good as they ever
were!—At least they shall not know it until all possibility
of Hammond’s union with Anna is destroyed,” said Alick
to himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>And that day he devoted himself with lover-like assiduity
to his Cousin Anna. And that night he remained
in town all night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alas, for Drusilla! She had fallen upon still darker
days; for now she never even knew when waiting up for
her husband, whether he would return or not.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still—still she strove against despondency and hoping
against hope, assumed some cheerfulness.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>

      <div class='line'>And the little lady grew silent and thin,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>And they all said she was ailing.—<span class='sc'>Robert Browning.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The young wife’s faith and hope were sinking under the
pressure of coldness and solitude; and only her undying
love survived in all its strength and beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was seriously ill, though she still kept up, moving
about the house to attend to her domestic affairs all day,
and sitting up to receive her husband half the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>And these exhausting duties of course made her worse.</p>

<p class='c011'>And oh, illness in woman is very repulsive to most men,
and especially to those of Alexander Lyon’s fastidious
nature and self-indulgent habits. Illness pales the cheeks
and dims the eyes; and worse than all, it frets the nerves
and tries the temper.</p>

<p class='c011'>So it was with Drusilla: weary and anxious, suffering in
mind and body, when Alexander came home near morning
she could not always welcome him with the happy glances
he had been accustomed to receive from her.</p>

<p class='c011'>And on these occasions her sad face and tearful eyes so
displeased and irritated him, that he would go off to his
own room without touching the refreshments that she had
got ready for him, or even stopping to bestow a kind word
upon her.</p>

<p class='c011'>He meant, by this conduct, to punish her for what, in his
thoughts, he called “her sulks.” But this sort of punishment
nearly broke her loving heart. He caused her depression
and then blamed her for being depressed. It was as
if he had crushed a violet and then blamed it for withering.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a pity, too, that just at this time such a contrast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>should have been exhibited between his brilliant, beautiful
and imperious cousin and his little, pale, drooping wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would spend the evening with Anna at some fashionable
assembly, where he saw her, in all the splendor of
beauty and pride of place, the all-admired belle of the
season, the reigning queen of society;—and then, full of
the intoxication of her new charms, he would return home
to find Drusilla, pale, weary and depressed, and he would
start off to his own room to curse the fate that had so long
blinded him to the transcendent attractions of his high-born
cousin, and bound him for life to the insignificant
daughter of his housekeeper. And the very bitterest
element in his misery was the thought that, sooner or later,
his old rival, Richard Hammond, must win the priceless
treasure that he himself had so madly cast away.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is to be feared that if at this time Alexander Lyon
could possibly have devised any means of secretly and
legally repudiating his young wife, he would not have
hesitated to do so. As it was, he estranged himself
from her, and passed more nights in his rooms at the
hotel than in his home at Cedarwood. But he never gave
the gentle creature a single harsh word or look; with all
his madness—and his mood was little less than madness—he
could not do either; he simply broke her spirit by
coldness, neglect and avoidance.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet, notwithstanding all this, if he had but known
it, in his heart of hearts it was Drusilla he loved and not
Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had made no mistake in marrying this sweet girl; it
had been a true inspiration that had drawn him towards her
when he was a youth and she a child. She was the better
half of his spirit, and the guardian angel of his life, as
well as the true love of his youth. And once he knew all
this to be true; but now he seemed to have forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides, Drusilla—soul and body, beyond all doubt or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>question—was his own; and therefore was she undervalued
and despised as something of little worth; while Anna was
unattainable by him, and likely to become the wife of his
rival; and therefore was Anna over-rated as a pearl beyond
price, and desired with passionate eagerness. But whatever
this phrenzy was, for the girl whom he had known from his
boyhood up, and in his thoughts rejected as a wife years
before—it was not love; it was probably a hallucination
made up of pride, jealousy, admiration, and the fascination
of the unattainable. Alexander Lyon had fancied
many a beauty in his life; but he had never once loved
any other than the young, devoted wife whom he now
so insanely wronged and grieved.</p>

<p class='c011'>And ah! how severely she suffered in secret, how bitterly
she wept over the ever-increasing estrangement; never
blaming him, however, even in her thoughts; blaming herself,
rather, for not being able to merit his love and make
him happy; never losing faith in him, but losing faith in
herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her love was without a taint of selfishness; but it was
not without sin, for it was idolatrous.</p>

<p class='c011'>She seemed to herself to have no life but in him. Failing
as she thought, to <i>merit</i> his love, and failing to make him
happy, she was willing to die to set him free and give him
peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Alick,” she said, in her heart, as she paced up and
down her forsaken chamber floor, wringing her hands and
weeping bitterly; “Poor Alick, it is not his fault that we
are both so miserable, it is mine. I am not a fit wife for
him; I never was; but I loved him so! I loved him so.
Ah, but if I had loved him rightly I never would have let
him shipwreck his life upon me—so unfit to be his mate.
He married me out of pity, and I let him do it, and now I
deserve to be wretched. But he is wretched too, though he
don’t deserve to be so. Ah! what can I do to undo all
this?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>And in the climax of her hysterical passion she was
almost ready to lay down her young life that her beloved
might step over it into liberty and light.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, why, oh, why did he ever ruin his hopes by wedding
me? Why? Oh, I know too well why. Poor Alick!
it was out of the goodness of his heart that he did it! He
was always so good to me from my infancy up, calling
me his child, giving me everything I needed, doing all
I asked. And when he saw me a poor little motherless
and homeless girl, he took pity on me, and raised me
up and put me on his bosom and comforted me and tried
to love me; but he cannot, because I am not lovable; and
now, even now, he never gives me an unkind word or look,
only stays away from me because he cannot love me, and he
is too honest to feign a love he cannot feel. Oh, Alick! I
would die to make you free and happy again, if it were not
a sin! I would, dear, I would!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the burden of her lamentations in her hours of
secret suffering.</p>

<p class='c011'>No word of these sad plaints reached his ears. Her
paroxysms of anguish would have exhausted themselves, or
she would have obtained some degree of self-command before
his late return home; so that though pale and sad, and
bearing the traces of recent tears, she met him with composure;
for she remembered, poor child, his abhorrence of
an ugly, weeping face.</p>

<p class='c011'>But now he had no mercy on her; she seemed to him a
fetter that galled him, and he pitied himself and not her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes, when she looked even more than usually pale
and ill, he wondered whether she was going to die; but he
wondered without alarm, and even without pity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla spent the long winter evenings in reading. She
read a great number of books, but they were not always
the most judiciously chosen, or the best calculated to cheer
her spirits or strengthen her mind.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Among the new works that Alexander brought home one
night and threw carelessly upon the table, was Mrs.
Crowe’s “Night Side of Nature.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And this book subsequently fell into Drusilla’s hands, and
she seized and read it with avidity. And worse than all,
she read it in her lonely night watches in that isolated
country house.</p>

<p class='c011'>The work, written with great power to prove the reality
of the re-appearance of departed spirits in this world, and
filled with accredited stories of apparitions, haunted houses,
marvellous visions, presentiments, omens, warnings, dreams,
et cetera, had a great fascination for Drusilla, and night
after night she pored over its dark pages with a morbid
fervor.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was another book that came in her way about the
same time, and exercised the same fatal spell over her impressible
imagination. It was that volume of De Quincy’s
works containing the “Three Memorable Murders,” and
worked up with all the fearful intensity of the Opium
Eater.</p>

<p class='c011'>The effect of these books upon her excitable nervous
system was terrible.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was owing very much to the circumstances under
which they were read. In a solitary house, in a deep wood,
in the dead of night, and in the depth of winter. And
often, her imagination would be so wrought upon, that she
would not dare to lift her eyes to the looking-glass over the
mantle-piece, lest she should meet there the reflection of
some face other than her own, nor venture to glance at the
windows on her left, for fear she should see some spectral
form peering in through the darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so, in the appalling solitude and silence of the
scene, and of the hour, imaginary terrors were added to real
troubles, and between them both her nervous system was
nearly broken down.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>It is true that she might have ameliorated her condition
in more than one way, but that she had too much consideration
for others and too little for herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>She might have gone to bed early each night but that
Alexander had no night key, and there was no one to let
him in whenever he pleased to return, except herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Also, she might have made Pina sit up to keep her company;
but she would not deprive the girl of rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lastly, she could at least have closed the window shutters
against that imaginary spectral form she always feared to
see; but she chose to leave them open that the light from
her drawing-room might cheer her beloved in his late
approach to the house—whenever he chose to come home;
which was not often at this period.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this state of things could not last forever; and a
crisis was at hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>One dark, still, winter night, when not a star was to be
seen in the sky, and the very air, as well as the earth and
the water seemed frozen—between two and three o’clock
after midnight, Drusilla sat alone in her drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>To while away the tedious hours she had read until her
eyes filmed and her brain reeled. And then she had been
compelled to lay aside her book, and sink back in her resting
chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the excited state of her nervous system she could not
sleep, for she was listening through the dead stillness of
deep night, hoping to hear the sound of the horse’s feet,
that was always the warning of her husband’s approach.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet she had no means of knowing whether he would
return that night or not.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she sat there waiting and listening, she could but
remember the possible dangers of her position.</p>

<p class='c011'>The house contained much of the sort of property that
tempt burglars—property at once very valuable and very
portable—such as silver and gold plate, jewels and money.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>She had been living in it now some months, and
secludedly as she lived, her abode there, and the richness
and defencelessness of the premises might well have come
to the knowledge of the professional burglars, whose acuteness
in discovering such rich mines of unprotected treasure
is much finer than that of the detectives who are always
supposed to be on their track.</p>

<p class='c011'>How easy—how perfectly easy it would be, she thought,
for even one resolute villain to break through those unprotected
glass windows, and murder her, and rob the house,
in safety and at leisure.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cottage was half a mile from any other dwelling
house, and a quarter of a mile from any public road. The
wildest shriek that might ever rise from dying victim in its
rooms, could never be heard by human ears without.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Drusilla remembered these circumstances her very
soul grew sick with terror. And was it any wonder?</p>

<p class='c011'>She was a young, delicate, impressible woman. And on
this dark night, and in this isolated house she was quite
alone. Her man-servant was in his loft over the stables,
where he slept, with pistols by his side, to guard the valuable
horses. And her maid-servant was in her attic over
the kitchen, in a distant part of the dwelling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Any determined thief could easily have entered the
house and worked his will upon the poor young neglected
wife and the property.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh Alick, dear Alick, if you could know how much I
suffer, you would not leave me so,” she groaned, wringing
her hands and rising in her restlessness to walk the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>But almost immediately her worshipping heart rebuked
her for having cast even a shadow of reproach upon her
husband, and she hastened to add,</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it is my own fault. He has done everything for
my comfort here; given me a beautiful home, and attentive
servants. And I ought to be happy and courageous.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Instead of that, I am sad and timid, and altogether unworthy
to be called his wife. I do not wonder that he
wearies of me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So weeping and wringing her hands she paced up and
down the floor, until in turning around she faced the front,
unclosed windows, and suddenly uttered a piercing shriek
and fell upon her face in a deadly swoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>And well she might. For peering in at the window,
from the darkness without was a livid white face—a man’s
stern face.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When Drusilla recovered from her deathly swoon, the
cold gray light of the winter morning was stealing through
the unshuttered windows.</p>

<p class='c011'>She lifted herself upon her elbow and gazed around her
in utter bewilderment. Slowly, slowly came memory back
to her. And with it the sense of fear and the instinct of
flight. But before she could command her chilled and
benumbed limbs, observation and reflection both assured her
that there was now no cause for alarm.</p>

<p class='c011'>The windows were still closed although the shutters were
open. Everything in the room was in its usual place.
Nothing had been disturbed. No intruder had been there.
Whose ever the face had been that had looked in upon her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>through the window in the dead of night, it had done no
harm.</p>

<p class='c011'>The feeling of relief with which Drusilla acknowledged
all this was speedily followed by one of extreme depression;
for by all the signs around her, she perceived that Alexander
had not yet come home.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lamps were still burning brightly in the face of the
broadening day. And the untasted supper sat in its
covered dishes on the hearth. But the fire had burned out
and the room was cold.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very drearily Drusilla arose; put out the lamps and then
went up to her own chamber, and rang the bell for her servant,
to make her a fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good patience, ma’am!” exclaimed the girl when she
entered the chamber and found the bed undisturbed, and
her mistress in the dress of the evening before. “Surely
ma’am, you have never been sitting up all night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not been in bed, as you see, Pina. Make me a
fire as quickly as you can, for I am very cold. And then
bring me some warm water and get me a cup of tea,” said
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>When all these orders had been obeyed, and the unhappy
young wife had refreshed herself with a wash, a change of
dress and a cup of hyson, and reclined at rest in her easy
chair, she said to her handmaid:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pina—go and bring your brother here, I wish to question
him in your presence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl started at this unusual order, and looked
alarmed, as if she supposed that herself and her brother
were to be arraigned upon some grave charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>But her mistress perceived her fears and hastened to
relieve them by saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be afraid, Pina; there is nobody in fault that I
know of. I only wish to question your brother upon a circumstance
that occurred last night. Now go at once and
fetch him here.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>The girl left the room and went to find her fellow servant,
who was in the kitchen eating his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must just leave off gormandizing this minute and
come up to <i>her</i> directly. Something’s up; but I don’t
know what it is. She says she wants to question you about
what happened last night, whatever that was, if you know,
for I don’t. I hope you’ve not been having unproper company,
and misbehaving of yourself up there in the stable
loft,” said Pina, breathlessly, as she stood before her
brother.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo, with his mouth full and his eyes starting, stared at
his sister in stupefaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, I say; come along with me up to the mistress,”
repeated Pina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What for? I haven’t been a doing of nothing!” exclaimed
the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, tell her so, then, and get her to believe it; but
come along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo reluctantly left his tea and muffins and bacon, and
hesitatingly followed Pina to the presence of his mistress,
where he also expected to be arraigned upon some charge of
misconduct.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the first worst words of the little lady set him at
ease.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leo, have you seen any suspicious persons or any
strangers lurking about here lately?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor, no ma’am, no person at all, not a soul, except ’twas
master and you, ma’am, and Pina and me. The place is
so out of the way, you know, ma’am. And so lonesome!
Awful lonesome I calls it,” answered the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No sportsmen after birds or other such small game?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a one, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor boys setting traps for snow-birds?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, ma’am. Bless you, ma’am, hasn’t I just told you
how I’ve never seen a human face about the place, except it
is you and master’s and me and Pina’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“Well, <i>I</i> saw a man’s face between two and three o’clock
after midnight, peeping in at the drawing-room windows,”
said the little lady very gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, ma’am!—whose could it a been?” inquired the
boy in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is what I do not know, and what I wished to
ascertain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy scratched his head and looked confounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A face a peeping in at the windows in the dead o’
night! Bless us and save us!” he muttered to himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be feared to stay in the house nights when the
master’s not in,” said Pina, turning as pale as one of her
color could.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope there is nothing to fear. I shall speak to your
master as soon as he comes home,” said Drusilla, to reassure
her domestics.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But there’s so many bugglers about,” said Pina, with a
shudder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And to be sure, the house is very unprotected like and
lonesome, and there’s a deal of silver and gold into it,”
added Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t think the face was that of a burglar. If it had
been, he might have entered the house and killed me, and
taken what he wanted. There was nothing to prevent
him,” said Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah-h-h!” screamed Pina, “I shall never dare to sleep
in the house when master is away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall ask your master to allow Leo to sleep in the
house when he himself means to be absent,” said Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But then they would steal the horses,” objected Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, and if they do? Ain’t the mistress’s life, to say
nothing of the gold and silver plate, and money and jewels,
a deal more vallearble than the hosses, you——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina stopped her tongue in time not to call her brother
bad names in her mistress’s presence.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“You may both go now. And, Pina, say nothing of
what has happened. And you, Leo, keep your faculties on
the alert and try to discover this mystery,” said the little
lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What—what is it I am to do with my factories,
ma’am?” inquired the boy, doubtingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are to keep your eyes and ears open and try to find
out who it was that looked into my window,” said Drusilla,
smiling even in the midst of her sadness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, ma’am,” answered the boy, as he bowed himself
out, followed by his sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>That day, owing to the alarm of the previous night and
the long swoon, and the awakening in the cold room,
Drusilla was unusually ill, both in mind and body; she
remained in her chamber, wrapped in her dressing gown
and reclining in her easy chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when evening came, from sheer force of habit, she
roused herself and gave orders for a fire to be kindled and
lamps to be lighted in the drawing-room, and supper to be
prepared in case her husband should return.</p>

<p class='c011'>And she dressed herself with care and went down and
seated herself in her usual place to be ready to receive
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But another long and lonely evening was before her,
with an unusual trial at its close.</p>

<p class='c011'>At ten o’clock, as usual, Pina came in to ask her mistress
if there were any more orders and to bid her good night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Pina, I want nothing more this evening. You
may go,” said Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Won’t you let me close the shutters, ma’am, for fear
that gashly face will look in again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Pina, they must be left open to guide your master
home. The night is very dark, and here are no gas-lighted
streets, you know,” smiled the little lady, determined not
to yield to her fears.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“Well, ma’am,” said the girl, hesitatingly—“Brother
Leo, ma’am, he says if you would take the ’sponsibility to
give him an order so to do, he would stay in the house
until master comes home. Shall I tell him to do it,
ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly not. Leo must not disobey his master; nor
can I interfere with Mr. Lyon’s arrangements,” answered
the faithful wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina looked distressed; and raising and rolling her
apron and casting down her eyes, she ventured to say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beg pardon, ma’am, but won’t you please be coaxed to
let Brother Leo stay in the house to take care of us instead
of the horses to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By no means, Pina. Say no more about it, my good
girl,” answered the little matron, firmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl looked up at her mistress to see if she was
really in earnest, and then burst into tears and sobbed forth
the broken words:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, ma’am, if you won’t let Brother Leo stay in here
to take care of the house an’ us, plea—plea—please let me
go long of him to the stable; becau—cau—cause I should
die of fright to stay here with nobody but you, ma’am,
please.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla looked at the maid in surprise and displeasure
for a minute, and then her beautiful benevolence got the
ascendancy over every other emotion, and she answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You poor, timid girl, go if you wish.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you won’t be ang—ang—angry long of me, ma’am,
I hope?” inquired Pina, half ashamed of herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No more than I should be angry with a hare for running
away. It is your nature, as it is the hare’s, to be cowardly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, ma’am, as Brother Leo is a waiting to
know what he is to do, I may go now, mayn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, go.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“Good night, ma’am, please; and I hope the Lord will
take care of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not doubt that He will, Pina. Good night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the girl retired.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla was left quite alone, not only in the room
but in the house. At first she felt very desolate and
depressed and inclined to cry. But presently she reasoned
with herself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That timid girl was really no protection. I am quite as
safe without her as with her. I must trust in the Lord without
whom ‘the watchman watcheth in vain.’ One of our
wisest sages said, to become heroic, we must be sure to do
that which we most fear to do. And I suppose his words
must be received in their spirit rather than in the letter. I
fear to jump into the fire, and I will not do so. And I fear,
oh, how I fear, to stay in this house alone to-night! And
all the more because I fear to do it, I <i>will</i> do it, rather than
break up my husband’s arrangements by calling Leo from
the stables to guard me, and rather than torture that poor
cowardly girl by making her stay here to keep me company.
But I will not touch De Quincey’s or Mrs. Crowe’s works
to-night to add to my morbid terrors. I will read the book
of comfort.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so saying, Drusilla took the Bible from its stand, and
opened at the Psalms of David, those inspired outpourings
of the soul, that have consoled and strengthened—how
many millions of suffering and fainting hearts, for how
many thousand years!</p>

<p class='c011'>We must now leave Drusilla to meet the events of the
night, and we must turn to Alexander, and relate the circumstances
that had kept him away from his home these
three days past—circumstances more ominous of evil to his
gentle wife than anything which had as yet happened at
Cedarwood.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was the short session of Congress, which would
close on the fourth of March. The fashionable season,
therefore, was nearly over, and it was ending in true carnival
style.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were morning concerts, theatricals, receptions,
etc., all day; and there were evening concerts, theatricals,
receptions, dinners, balls and parties all night. And
“everybody who was anybody” was expected to “show”
at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>The belle of the season went everywhere; and often appeared
at half a dozen different scenes of festivity or revelry
in one night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her constant escort, Alexander Lyon, had no sinecure.
He went with her everywhere; partly because his uncle
willed that he should go with her, and he could not well
refuse without explaining his reasons for doing so, and he
could not explain, without acknowledging his secret marriage
with Drusilla; partly because he imagined himself in
love with his brilliant cousin; but mostly because he determined
that Richard Hammond should not supplant him in
his office of escort.</p>

<p class='c011'>For two days during which he had not appeared at his
home, he had been on a “perpetual” round of pleasure with
Anna. The first day he attended her to a breakfast given
at the Executive Mansion; to a <i><span lang="fr">matinèe musicale</span></i> at the
French minister’s; to an afternoon debate in the Senate Chamber;
to a dinner party at General Stott’s; and to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>theatre to see a celebrated comedienne; and, lastly, to a
supper at General Lyon’s room; all this in one day and
evening; so, of course, he could not get home that night.
The next day he went with her, first to a wedding at St.
John’s church, and to the wedding-breakfast at the house of
the bride’s mother; then to hear part of a very interesting
case at the Supreme Court; next to the reception of a
cabinet minister; then to an exhibition of paintings; from
that to a dinner party at the Brazilian minister’s; and,
finally, to the very grandest hall of the carnival, given by
the wife of a millionaire, who had taken a furnished house
for the season, and reserved herself for this final magnificent
affair.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was considered a great distinction to get an invitation
to this ball. Only the “elite” were invited, and all the
“elite” were there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna, restricted by her mourning to a certain style of
dress was still, as always, the most beautiful and the most
admired woman of the assembly. And Alexander was
proud of her as his reputed betrothed.</p>

<p class='c011'>In all the success of the season Anna had never had
such a dazzling triumph as upon this evening. She seemed
to turn all heads with her bewitching beauty, until at
length her own brain seem dizzied with her conquests. She
grew capricious and exasperating. Alexander hovered
around her; and he would not have left her for a moment
that evening if she had not, with a furtive and angry flash
of her blazing blue eyes, peremptorily ordered him to leave
her. And to complete his mortification and despair, she
beckoned Richard Hammond to come to her, and she retained
him in her suite for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander was half maddened by this conduct of his
cousin. His blood boiled when he saw her smiling upon
his rival; and when he saw that rival basking in those
smiles; and he would have liked to have throttled Richard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>then and there; but he knew that it would never do to
make a scene in that place; so he stood scowling and muttering
curses, and planning vengeance.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon, who for once had been tempted to come
out in the evening for the sake of being present at this
great ball, and meeting many of his old friends whom he
knew would be there, saw the provoking behavior of the
young pair and resolved that as soon as he should have
them at home he would favor the coquette and the rival
with a good sound reprimanding lecture. But the festivities
were kept up all night; and so the old soldier, who
broke down at about one o’clock, was forced to retire and
leave the beauty and her rival lovers to their own devices.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not, however, without whispering to each of the delinquents
in turn:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall want to see you at my rooms to-morrow at
twelve noon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was broad daylight when the ball broke up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna was at length under the necessity of giving Richard
his congee, and resigning herself to the charge of Alexander,
who, having escorted her to the ball, was of course
obliged to take her home.</p>

<p class='c011'>On reaching her lodgings, Anna went to bed to sleep off
her fatigue. And Alexander, who had hardly spoken during
the drive home, hurried off to his rooms at the Blank
House, to procure what rest he could before the hour at
which he was to wait upon his uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>At twelve o’clock precisely, the old soldier, having breakfasted,
was seated in his private parlor waiting for his fractious
young people.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna was the first to come in. And her grandfather
was just clearing his throat to begin upon her when the
door was opened and Mr. Richard Hammond was
announced.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! very well, it is just as easy to speak to you both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>at the same time,” said the old gentleman, turning around
in his chair and facing the culprits.</p>

<p class='c011'>And very imposing looked the veteran as he sat there
with his majestic person, grave countenance and silver hair
and beard.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the young cousins were certainly awed by the
dignity of his aspect as well as abashed by a sense of their
own follies.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come and stand before me, sir and madam.” (This
gentleman of the old school, always on ceremonious occasions,
addressed ladies, whether married or single, by the
title of “madam,” which in its true meaning is simply <i><span lang="fr">ma
dame</span></i>, or my lady, and applies with equal propriety to
maids or matrons.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir and madam, come and stand before me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the young people, with the reverence they had been
educated to show to age, approached and stood before the
old man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their ready obedience mollified him to a certain extent;
for when he spoke again it was in a milder manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My daughter and my nephew,” he said, “your conduct
lately, and especially your deportment last evening, has
shamed and grieved me. It might be said of our ancient
house, as it has been said of another noble line, that all the
men were brave and all the women pure. Let me not see
in you two the first exceptions to that proud rule.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The cheeks of the young lady and the brow of the young
gentleman flushed crimson with mortification; but neither
spoke, and the old gentleman continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No brave man ever tries to supplant an accepted suitor.
And no pure woman ever encourages the rival of her betrothed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The flush deepened on the cheeks of Anna and on the
brow of Richard, and both cast down their eyes, but neither
opened their lips.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“And,” proceeded the veteran hero, “I should blush for
the daughter of my house who should prove a coquette, as I
should blush for the son who should prove a coward. My
children, I hope I have said enough. Be brave as all the
men of our line, and pure as all its women.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Richard,” said Anna, with eyes flashing through their
tears, “Cousin Richard, you must bid me farewell here,
now, and forever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He took the hand she extended to him, and holding it
within his own, turned to his uncle and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, you <i>have</i> said enough, and so has my cousin.
What it costs me to leave her, only heaven knows. But
you have made an appeal that cannot be resisted, and I bow
before it. Farewell, sir! And Anna, my cousin, good-bye!
Good-bye! God bless you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And after wringing Anna’s hand, he dropped it, bowed
to his uncle, and hastened away to conceal the tears that
rushed to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna threw herself down upon the sofa, buried her head
in its pillows, and sobbed convulsively.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man, with his hands clasped behind his back,
and his silver-haired head bowed upon his bosom, walked
slowly up and down the floor. At length, he came to his
sobbing daughter, and laying his hand tenderly upon her
head, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sorry, Anna. I am sorry, my child. I would I
could bear all pain in your stead. But, Anna, I cannot
bear this pang for you. And you know that faith must be
kept, though hearts be grieved—aye, or——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he could finish his sentence, the door was opened,
and Mr. Lyon was announced.</p>

<p class='c011'>On seeing Alexander enter, Anna started up from the
sofa, and hurried from the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good morning, sir. I hope I have not disturbed my
cousin?” said Mr. Lyon, bowing, and shaking hands with
his uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“Sit down, Alick,” said the old man, without replying
to his observation. “I wish to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander seated himself, and looked attentive.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick, I saw how much annoyed you were last night by
Richard’s marked attentions to Anna, and her seeming
encouragement of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Seeming,’ sir! It was more than seeming; and much
more than mere ‘encouragement.’ Sir, she solicited those
attentions,” said Alexander, with scarcely suppressed
indignation, and entirely forgetting that <i>he</i> certainly had
no right to object to all this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tut, tut, tut, tut, boy, that is very strong language.
However, I can overlook it, as the provocation was very
great. But, Alick, it was only the mischievous spirit of a
spoiled beauty on her part, and the vanity of a coxcomb on
his. I have had them both up before me this morning, and
spoken some words to them that they will not readily
forget. Anna has dismissed Richard once for all. And he
has bid us good-bye, and is gone for good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander looked up in surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it is so,” said the general.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me, sir, was that the reason why my cousin
was so very much overcome, and ran from the room as soon
as I came in?” questioned Alexander, his jealous doubts
again awakening.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Um-m, well, you see I had said some pretty severe
words to her and made her cry. But it is well she is gone,
as I have something to say to you in private.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes sir?” said Alexander, hesitatingly and with a
guilty twinge, for his conscience immediately awakened his
fears. What was it his uncle wanted to say to him? Had
the old man got an inkling of the cottage at Cedarwood
and its inmates? Scarcely likely he thought, but still he
felt uneasy until the general said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alexander my boy, it is now nearly five months since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the lamented death of your dear mother, my esteemed sister-in-law.
And I do not for my part, see why your marriage
with Anna should be longer deferred. Long engagements
are very injudicious indeed; and your engagement has been
an exceedingly prolonged one. And I think now that it
should terminate in marriage. Come, what do you say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander turned hot and cold; attempted to speak and
failed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old gentleman ascribed all his emotion to excess of
love, surprise and joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, my boy, I really mean it,” he said, smiling. “To
defer the affair longer would not be so much of a respectful
tribute to the memory of your dear mother, as a superstitious
observance. Come! find your tongue, man! find
your tongue!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The question must be referred to my beautiful betrothed
sir. It will be for her to decide it,” said Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, aye, certainly, to be sure; it will be for her to
decide it; but it will be for <i>you</i> to induce her to decide it
in your favor, my lad,” chuckled the old gentleman.
“And as you are to take her to see Saviola’s new picture to-day,
you will have a fine opportunity of doing so,” he
added.</p>

<p class='c011'>At that moment the door was again opened, and Commodore
Staughton was announced.</p>

<p class='c011'>And as the old naval hero entered the room, Alexander
arose and bowed and made his escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mr. Lyon did not attend his cousin to the picture
gallery that afternoon. Anna pleaded excessive fatigue,
and with good reason, and kept her room until evening,
when she went, attended by Alexander, to a reception at
the Executive Mansion, that was the last and greatest of
the season.</p>

      <div class='line'>’Tis only the obscure is terrible;</div>
      <div class='line'>Imagination frames events unknown,</div>
      <div class='line'>In wild fantastic shapes of hideous ruin,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what it fears, creates.—<span class='sc'>Hannah More.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was two hours after midnight, on a keen March morning,
when Alexander Lyon, in the face of a fierce northwest
wind, rode on towards his almost forsaken home.</p>

<p class='c011'>His frame of mind was not enviable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never since he had entered upon his life of deception had
his double-dealing so much disturbed him. The discovery
of his duplicity was now impending. His uncle had proposed
his immediate marriage with his betrothed; and
should the obstinate old gentleman persist in pushing on
the project, and should Anna raise no objection to it,
there would be no other course for Alexander to pursue but
frankly to confess his secret marriage with Drusilla, and so
brave the old soldier’s roused wrath, and bear the young
beauty’s bitter scorn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, still Mr. Lyon resolved to delay the degradation of
such a disclosure, and the shame of such a scene as long as
possible, for still he hoped, “out of this nettle danger to
pluck the flower safety.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was possible, he thought, that his uncle might not persevere
in his purpose, and it was probable that Anna herself
would be the first to object to a precipitated wedding, and
would insist that the programme should be followed, and
that the full year of mourning for his mother should elapse
before Alexander should claim her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>There yet remained nearly eight months to the end of
this probation. In this time, how much, he reflected, might
happen to deliver him from his disagreeable dilemma.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span><i>Drusilla might die.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>He felt a pang of shame and sorrow as this idea entered
his mind. Yet still he entertained it. Drusilla was now
declining in health, and she might die. And in such a case
he should be free from the trammels of his reckless marriage,
and from the necessity of making the humiliating confession
that he had ever worn them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Agitated by these evil thoughts, he rode rapidly onward
towards Cedarwood.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he entered the private road leading through the dark
wood he saw the beacon lights of his home in the drawing-room
windows, shining out to guide him on his way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is waiting for me, poor child,” he said, half in compassion,
half in contempt. “Still waiting and watching
as she has been doing no doubt, for the last three nights—the
last three nights! Ah! and how many nights behind
them! Poor little miserable! I wish I had never seen
her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So muttering to himself Alexander rode around to the
stable and put up his horse, and then walked back to the
house and knocked at the front door.</p>

<p class='c011'>It did not fly open as usual at his summons, so he knocked
again, louder than before; but there was no response.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he sounded an alarm upon the knocker, and waited
for the result.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when the noise he made died away, all remained
silent in the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What the deuce is the meaning of this, I should like to
know?” he inquired of himself, as he went down the steps
and climbed up to the sill of the front windows, and looked
into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>The room was brilliantly lighted up, but the fire in the
grate had burned low; the untasted supper covered up on
the hearth had probably grown cold; and the little guardian
angel of the place was no where to be seen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“Where the mischief can she be?” he asked himself;
and having frequently expressed annoyance that she should
sit up late to let him in, he now felt vexation that she
should have gone to rest, and left him to get in as he could.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was nothing now for him to do but to go back to
the stable and rouse up his man-servant, and get the key of
the kitchen door, by which that functionary always let himself
in in the morning to make the fires.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo slept in the loft over the carriage-room, which was
shut off from the horse stalls, and locked within.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it required considerable knocking and calling before
the man could be awakened.</p>

<p class='c011'>When at last he aroused he started up in terror shouting;</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who’s there? Thieves! murder! fire!—go away, or
I’ll shoot!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Coward, and fool!—come down and open the door!”
loudly and angrily exclaimed his master.</p>

<p class='c011'>But before Mr. Lyon had fairly got the words out of his
mouth Leo put his pistol out of the window, and pulled the
trigger and blazed away.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ball whizzed past within an inch of the ear of Alexander,
who instinctively dodged and shrank out of the
range of fire, as he shouted:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stop that, you villain! What do you mean, you poltroon?
It is I, your master.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the man was mad with terror; and even while his
master spoke, fired again and again, until he had discharged
six shots from his revolver; and then he retired from the
window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, you scoundrel!” again shouted Mr. Lyon, as
soon as silence was restored. “Do you hear me—do you
know me now? I am your master. Come down and open
the door; I want you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A minute passed, and then the voice of Leo was heard
from above, calling cautiously:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Marse Alick, Marse Alick! Is it you, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course it is I, you cursed idiot! who else should it
be? And it is very well for you that I am living to answer,
and you are not a murderer. Come down instantly, I say,
and open the door.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor, Leo, chile, it is marster; I knows his speech. So
let him in,” spoke another low voice, which Mr. Lyon, in
astonishment, recognized as belonging to Pina.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another minute passed, and then Leo came down, with
his teeth chattering from cold and fright, and opened the
door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, you villain! what have you got to say for
yourself, that I shall not have you committed to jail to-morrow
on charge of assault with intent to kill?” angrily
demanded Mr. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Marse Alick! I’m as much mortified at the mistake
as ever I can be. Indeed, sir, I thought it was horse
thieves, and I was duty bounden to ’fend the hosses, you
know, sir,” pleaded Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Umph; well, you must be more careful another time,
my man. Your mistake might have cost you your neck,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Deed, sir, I—if I had been so misfortunate as to hurt
you I shouldn’t a cared <i>that</i> for my neck! I should a
wanted to a’ hanged myself ’dout waitin’ for the judge to
do it,” said the boy, so earnestly that he at once disarmed
his master.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, I dare say you speak truly. And now let
me have the key of the back door; I wish to get in the
house and go to bed. Your mistress has shut up the place
and retired. I suppose she has given up all thoughts of
seeing me to-night. Where is the key?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here it is, sir; shall I go on to the house with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, there is no need. Oh, by the way—was not that
Pina’s voice I heard speaking to you?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And pray how comes she to be sleeping down here in
the stable loft, when she should be in the house with her
mistress? And now I think of it, how <i>is</i> your mistress?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, purty much the same as usual, sir,” said Leo, trying
to evade the ‘previous question.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad to hear it. But about Pina; how comes
she to be sleeping here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir, you see there’s been a ’larm at the house;
and Pina, she was feared—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘An alarm at the house?’ What sort of an alarm?”
anxiously inquired Mr. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir, if you will please to let me walk along home
with you I could tell you as I go along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come then and be quick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh lor, Brother Leo, ask master to wait for me, please.
I don’t dare to stay here all alone by myself!” exclaimed
Pina, scuttling down from the loft as fast as she could
come.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hurry then, you provoking fool; and mind, I have an
account to settle with you when you come,” said Mr. Lyon,
as he stamped his feet and clapped his hands to keep his
almost congealed blood in circulation, while the fierce wind
whirled his riding-coat round and round.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime Leo quickly took down his own overcoat from
its peg in the coach-room, and put it on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now then! How dared you to leave your mistress and
come down here to sleep, eh?” angrily demanded Mr.
Lyon, as Pina came to the side of her brother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please, sir, it was along of the fright. And mistress
said I might. And no more wasn’t she angry long o’ me
for it,” whimpered the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your kind mistress is never angry with anybody for
anything,” answered Mr. Lyon, doing justice to his
neglected young wife, on this occasion at least. “And,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>he added, “I will hear what she has to say about the matter
before I excuse you. And now, Leo,” he inquired,
turning to the boy, “what about this alarm at the house?
I hope it was a false one. Was it of thieves?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir, I don’t rightly know whether it was a false
alarm or not, nor likewise whether it was thieves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me all you know of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, I don’t know anything about it personably
myself. It was not me as seen the face at the window,
in the dead hour of the night, it was my mistress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘A face at the window in the dead of night?’” echoed
Mr. Lyon, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Last night, sir, about this hour, as I understand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give me the particulars.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo began and related the story, as he had received it
from his mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is most extraordinary and it must be investigated,”
said Mr. Lyon, in a musing and anxious manner, as
the boy finished the tale. “But,” he added, turning
sternly to the two servants, “how came you, you cowardly
brutes, to leave your young mistress alone in the house to-night
after such an alarm? I feel inclined to part with
you both.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, sir,” said Leo, “I begged my mistress to allow me
to stay in the house to keep guard, I did, indeed, sir; but
she wouldn’t so much as hear of it. She said how she
wouldn’t interfere long of your arrangements, sir; and so
she ordered me to go back to the stables and take care o’
the hosses.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And indeed, master, indeed, sir,” put in Pina, “I did
say to my mist’ess wasn’t her safety of more ’count than
the dumb brutes; but she wouldn’t hear to me, no more’r
to Brother Leo.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“And so she sent you both out of the house!” exclaimed
Mr. Lyon, frowning darkly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed she did, sir,” answered Pina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And remained in it alone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir,” replied Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph!” growled Mr. Lyon, and his anger was diverted
from his offending servants to his neglected wife.
An insane suspicion took possession of him, and he mentally
connected the mysterious face at the window, with the
circumstance of Drusilla’s sending her servants from the
house, and he drew an inference which nothing but the
madness of jealousy could have inspired, and he hurried on
at a pace which even his agile young servants found it hard
to keep up with.</p>

<p class='c011'>They went around to the back door and opened it, and
Mr. Lyon, calling his servants to follow him through the
house, groped his way along the dark back passages to the
octagon hall and up the stairs to his wife’s chamber, which
was dimly lighted by a night-taper on the mantle-piece and
a smouldering fire in the grate. The room was vacant and
evidently had not been occupied since the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where can she be?” he inquired, and in an accession
of anxiety he hurried through the other rooms of the
upper story; but found them all empty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, still attended by his servants, he went below stairs
and searched the library and the bird room. But neither
Drusilla nor any one else could be found.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I looked into the drawing-room before I entered the
house—looked in through the unshuttered front windows
and I saw that no one was in there. But I will look again,”
muttered Mr. Lyon, in extreme astonishment and anxiety,
as he passed into the apartment in question.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was still brilliantly lighted up and he could see into
every corner of it; but he saw, besides the usual furniture,
only the neatly spread little supper table; the untasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>supper covered up on the hearth; and the easy chair and
slippers near the blackened fire that had quite gone out.</p>

<p class='c011'>But his wife was nowhere to be seen in the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is most inexplicable!” he exclaimed, in consternation,
as he turned and looked at his servants, who
stood near him aghast with terror. “At what hour did
your mistress dismiss you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At ten o’clock, sir; but we didn’t go out of the house
till nearly half-past, as it took us some little time to rake
out the kitchen fire and fasten up the place,” answered Leo,
while Pina fell to sobbing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stop that noise, will you, and follow me. I will search
the rooms over the kitchen; though I suppose it will be
quite in vain,” said Mr. Lyon, grimly, as there entered his
mind the cruel suspicion that his neglected and lonely
young wife had actually left her home.</p>

<p class='c011'>They searched first the kitchen, pantry and laundry, on
the first floor of the back building. Then they went up
and searched the servants’ rooms on the second floor. But
without success.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is gone,” said Mr. Lyon to himself, as he led the
way back to the drawing-room. And in the strangely
blended emotions of astonishment and mortification, there
was also a delusive feeling of satisfaction and hope. If she
was gone, he should be free. Her departure was his deliverance.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he re-entered the drawing-room, still attended by his
servants, he saw the broad morning light streaming in at
the front windows. He ordered Leo to take away the
lamps and to clear out the grate and kindle a new fire.
And he directed Pina to remove the supper service and prepare
his breakfast; for, under all the circumstances, he felt
too much excited to think of lying down to sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>He walked up and down the room, while his servants
quickly executed his orders. And soon every vestige of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>the evening’s untasted repast and extinguished fire was removed.
And the clean hearth and glowing grate invited
Alexander to repose himself in his easy chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a while Pina appeared with the table linen in her
hand, and inquired, respectfully:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, sir, will you have the breakfast laid here,
or in the dining-room?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the dining-room, of course,” answered Mr. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The dining-room,” as the reader knows, was but a cozy,
elegant, little recess, curtained off from the drawing-room,
and only large enough to hold a small table and two chairs,
for the young couple’s tête-à-tête dinners.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Pina now drew aside the crimson curtain, she uttered
a wild scream, and stood transfixed and gazing down upon
some object near her feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander sprang up to see what had frightened her; but
as he put aside the curtain, and saw what was under it, he
started back with an irrepressible cry of horror.</p>

<p class='c006'>She whom they had sought so vainly, lay there, doubled
up, on the floor, and partly covered by the dropping folds
of the curtain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, master! Oh, sir! She is dead! She is murdered!
She is, indeed, sir, and the thieves have been in and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>done it!” cried Pina, recovering her voice and wringing
her hands in grief and terror.</p>

<p class='c011'>And her dreadful words seemed to be true.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lyon could not speak. He silently lifted the lifeless
form, and shuddering to see how helplessly the head
and limbs fell over his arms, he bore it into the drawing-room,
and laid it on the sofa.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina followed him, and stood sobbing and wringing her
hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knelt down by the body and gazed on the marble
face, the half-open eyes, and the rigid lips drawn tightly
from the white and glistening teeth.</p>

<p class='c011'>He hastily unfastened the front of her dress, and put his
hand in her bosom to feel if her heart yet beat. It seemed
still.</p>

<p class='c011'>He put his ear down to listen if her lungs yet moved.
They were motionless.</p>

<p class='c011'>He felt her hands and feet. They were cold and stiff.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he arose and stood gazing upon the body.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, is she dead? Is you sure?” inquired Pina, with
tears streaming down her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. She seems to have been dead some hours;”
groaned Alexander, with his own face as white as that of
the lifeless form before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, master! Oh, sir! The thieves broke in and done
it, didn’t they? Didn’t they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know,” said Mr. Lyon, speaking slowly and
softly. “There is no evidence of the late presence of
thieves in the house. Nothing as yet is missing. And
there is no sign of blood upon her clothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, master, but her dress is black, and wouldn’t
show it plain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander knew this to be true, and he also knew that
some wounds bleed only inwardly. So he began to examine
her body. First he unloosed her beautiful hair, and ran his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>fingers through its tresses, and felt all over her head. But
apparently she had received no sort of injury there.</p>

<p class='c011'>While he was proceeding with this inspection, Pina suddenly
started up and ran out of the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>He made a most careful examination, but found no mark
of violence upon her person.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet he thought she must have come to her death
suddenly and violently; since she had been alive and in
her usual health between ten and eleven o’clock on the preceding
evening, and now was dead, and apparently had been
so for several hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had scarcely finished his examination, when Pina
rushed back into the room, holding a fragment of looking-glass
in her hand, and exclaiming eagerly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Try this! Oh, dear master, try this! Lay it to her
lips and hold it there a minute or so, and if there’s any
moisture on it, it is a sign that there’s a little life left, and
where there’s life, you know, if there’s ever so little, there’s
hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lyon silently took the piece of glass, and laid it flat
with the bright side to the cold lips, and stood watching
the result.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, sir, I’m glad I happened to think of it! I know’d
a woman, I did, who fell down into a fit, and lay for dead
all day long; for her breath had stopped, and her heart
had stopped, and she was cold and stiff; and they were
going to lay her out, when somebody said ‘try a glass,’ and
so they tried it, and sure enough, after they held it over her
lips a little while, there was a moisture on it, and so they
knew she still breathed ever so little, though they couldn’t
perceive it in any other way but by the glass—and so—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, stop,” said Mr. Lyon, interrupting the garrulous
girl, and examining the glass.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a dimness on its bright surface.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are right. Life is not yet quite extinct. She still
breathes slightly.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“Oh, sir, I’m so glad! I feel as glad as if—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hurry and make a fire in her bed-chamber, while I
carry her up stairs,” said Mr. Lyon, again interrupting the
stream of the girl’s talk.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina flew down stairs to get kindling wood, and to startle
her brother with the news that their mistress had been
found in a fainting fit so deep that she seemed dead, or
dying, at the last gasp, and it was doubtful whether she
would ever come out of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, Alexander lifted the insensible form and carried
it up stairs, to the bed-chamber, and laid it on the bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina soon came in with the kindling wood and rapidly
revived the fire that had not yet gone out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, while her master ran down stairs and searched for
restoratives, she undressed her mistress and put her between
soft, warm blankets, in the bed, and began to rub her hands
and feet in the hope of restoring the arrested circulation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lyon returned with brandy and ammonia, and then
master and maid used the most vigorous means for recovering
the unconscious sufferer.</p>

<p class='c011'>For nearly two hours they worked over her; but their
efforts seemed utterly unavailing.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length when they were almost ready to give over in
despair, Alexander perceived a slight fluttering near the
heart of his wife. With revived hope, he redoubled his
efforts and soon had the satisfaction of seeing further signs
of returning life. Her chest labored and heaved; her lips
trembled and parted; and then she gasped and opened her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusa, Drusa, my darling, do you know me?” he inquired,
looking anxiously in her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she only gazed at him, with wide open, soft inexpressive
eyes, without replying.</p>

<p class='c011'>He hastily mixed a little ammonia and water and raised her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>head and put the cordial to her lips. She drank it mechanically;
but it immediately revived her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusa, my little Drusa, do you know me now?” he inquired,
setting the glass aside and bending over her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked at him with infinite love, put her arms up
around his neck, drew his head down to hers and kissed him
tenderly.</p>

<p class='c011'>He returned her soft caresses, for while he gazed on her
sweet, patient, loving face, and reflected that she was just
rescued, as it were, from the jaws of death, he felt all his
compassion, if not his affection for her, revived.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What caused your swoon, my little Drusa?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>But a spasm of pain, or fear, passed over her face and
form, and she shuddered and closed her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beg your pardon, sir, but if I was you, I wouldn’t ask
no questions yet,” said Pina in a low respectful voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are right again,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he contented himself with sitting by his wife’s bed
and holding her hand, and occasionally bending down and
kissing her forehead.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please sir, to let me go down and bring my
mistress up a cup of strong tea and a bit of dry toast, I
think if she could be got to take it, it would do her good,”
said Pina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go then,” replied Mr. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>And as the girl left the room, he stooped and whispered
to his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope you are better, love.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will not try your strength with questions, now; but as
soon as you are able, you will tell me what caused your deep
swoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She drew his head down to hers and answered in a low,
faint voice:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“<i>It was the face at the window.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The face at the window! again last night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She nodded; and her lips grew so white and her eyes so
wild with terror, that he hastened to soothe her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, there is no danger now, my little Drusa! I am
here by your side. Compose yourself for the present, and
when you have quite recovered you shall tell me all about
it, and the affair shall be investigated.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laid his hand upon her brow; and she with a sigh of
relief, closed her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently Pina came in with a little tray upon which
stood a cup of tea and a small piece of dried toast.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Alexander’s entreaty and with his assistance,
Drusilla sat up and drank the tea and ate the toast, and
then sank back upon her pillow and after a while, with her
hand in his, fell into a natural and refreshing sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander still watched her for five or ten minutes
longer, and then after glancing up at the time-piece on
the mantle shelf and seeing that it was nearly eleven
o’clock he slipped his hand from hers, told Pina to take
his place by the bedside, and then left the chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went down stairs into the drawing-room and rang
the bell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo answered it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Serve my breakfast immediately and then go and
saddle my horse and bring him around to the door,” were
Mr. Lyon’s directions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo, much wondering that his master should leave his
mistress at such a time, went out of the room to obey his
orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>Breakfast was soon served. Alexander dispatched it in
haste, and then went up stairs to change his dress for his
ride into town.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he found himself alone in his dressing-room, all
the embarrassments of his false position—forgotten during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>the exciting events that had followed his late arrival at
home—were now recalled to mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>In an hour or two he should meet his uncle and his
cousin. The former would expect that he should make his
proposal for immediate marriage with Anna, and the latter
would be ready to meet it.</p>

<p class='c011'>He might either make the anticipated proposal or omit
to do it.</p>

<p class='c011'>If he should make it, and his cousin should meet it
favorably, the embarrassments of his position would be
multiplied a thousand fold, for certainly he could not marry
two wives; neither could he, after having committed himself
by his proposal, confess his prior marriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>If he should omit to make the proposal at all, such
omission would subject him to suspicion and severe cross-examination
by his uncle and the grandfather of his
betrothed.</p>

<p class='c011'>His first hope, then, was in being able to evade the
dilemma by procrastination; and his second hope was that
Anna herself might take the responsibility of insisting
upon a further delay of the wedding.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for his secret marriage with Drusilla, he was now
resolved, come what might, that he would never reveal it;
because he felt sure, if he should do so, that his uncle and
cousin would both discard him, and she would become the
wife of his rival.</p>

<p class='c011'>But even in the midst of these evil thoughts, he started
as an absent-minded walker might at seeing himself on
the brink of a dreadful precipice,—yes, started with a sudden
consciousness of what a villain he was growing to be—he
who up to this time had been a man of stainless honor.</p>

<p class='c011'>While agitated by these emotions, he was mechanically
dressing himself. He went to his wardrobe to search for a
thick coat, for the morning was still bitterly cold, and the
overcoat that he had worn on the previous day and night
had received some damage from Leo’s frantic pistol shots.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>He took down coat after coat, but they were all too thin.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, far back in the wardrobe, he found one that
he had not worn for many months. It belonged to the
travelling suit that he had worn when he went to Alexandria
to meet Drusilla and went to the parson to marry her.</p>

<p class='c011'>With feelings of sadness, regret and compunction, he
turned the garment about and looked at it. Then he carefully
brushed it and put it on, buttoned it closely, and
thrust both hands in his pockets to push them down. In
doing so, he felt a folded paper. And in listless curiosity
he took it out, opened it, and looked at it.</p>

<p class='c011'>In an instant all his listlessness vanished. He held it
from him, and gazed, and gazed at it with his eyes dilating,
his lips parting, and his face blanching with what would
have seemed at first view to be amazement and horror, but
which soon proved to be delight and triumph.</p>

<p class='c011'>He could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses. He
suspected that he was dreaming. He pinched himself to
prove that he was awake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he suddenly dropped into a chair, waved the paper
above his head, and burst into a loud laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” he said, “if I had been the most consummate
schemer that ever lived, I could not have plotted for myself
better than fortune has planned for me. Now, then, Mr.
Richard Hammond! Let us see now what are your prospects
of ultimately winning the beauty and the heiress!
But little Drusa! poor little Drusa! patient, loving little
Drusa! Thank fortune that you neither know nor suspect
anything of this matter! And you <i>must</i> neither know nor
suspect it yet awhile! For the knowledge, or even the
very suspicion of this, would go near to kill you. Very,
very gradually must you be prepared for it, my darling;
very, very gently must the truth be broken to you, my poor
little girl!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He felt now no embarrassment as to his relations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>present or prospective, with his betrothed and her grandfather.
He was ready to propose to Anna the next day,
and to marry her in a month after, if expedient.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the paper that he had found in the pocket of his
wedding coat, and now held in his hand, proved, beyond
the shadow of a doubt, that his marriage with poor
Drusilla was informal, null and void; that it had always
been so, and that he was legally free to love and to wed
whomsoever he should please.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Although that little paper furnished a proof that
Alexander Lyon was as free from marriage-bonds as he
wished to be, yet it would have been better for his own purpose
for him to have burned it at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>But with that strange unwillingness which some people
feel to destroy even a dangerous document, he carefully
folded it up and put it into his little looking-glass
drawer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he went into the next chamber and spoke to Pina,
who was still watching by her mistress’s bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Has she moved?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh no, sir, she sleeps very sound,” answered the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is well. Keep her very still. Keep the room
dark and quiet. Do not leave her until my return. If
she should wake in the meantime, tell her that I was compelled
to ride into town this morning; but that I shall be
back early. Do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Yes, sir; and I will be very careful to do as you say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander then drew on his gloves and left the room.
When he got down stairs he repeated to Leo his orders, that
the house should be kept very quiet. Then he mounted his
horse and rode rapidly towards the city. He was an hour
behind his usual time, and it was noon when he reached his
room at the hotel. He was glad to find out by inquiry that
no one had called that morning to see him. So he went
down stairs to call a cab, to take him to his uncle’s lodgings.
He found the hotel halls, as well as the city streets, full of
bustle. Yesterday had been the last day of the session of
Congress, and to-day there was a general evacuation of the
city, by members of the house and senate, and by the troops
of friends and strangers that attend or follow them to and
from Washington.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alick found it hard to get an empty cab, so he hailed an
omnibus, and rode on as far as it would take him to his
uncle’s lodgings, and then got out and walked the rest of
the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>The general had just left his bedroom; but he received
his visitor very cordially.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you what, Alick, these fashionable hours don’t
suit an old-fashioned fellow like myself. And I am heartily
glad the season is over. As soon as Anna comes down I
shall tell her to give orders to pack up; for we shall leave in
a day or two—just as soon as the great crush of travellers
shall thin off, so that the steamboats and the railway trains
will not be so overcrowded. By the way, I hope you made
it all right with Anna last night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please to recollect, my dear sir, that I could not possibly
get an opportunity of speaking to her in private. But
I shall make one to-day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, my dear boy, and I will help you. And I
hope you will make up your mind to leave this babel when
we do. What is to prevent you, eh? You might go back
with us to the old hall.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“I should be very happy to do so, sir; and if I can make
arrangements——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, bosh about arrangements! What arrangements
can an idle young man like you have to make? None that
could not be made in twenty-four hours. And we shall not
leave for at least forty-eight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will try to be ready, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Alick spoke, Anna came in.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wore an elegant morning robe of white cashmere
lined and faced with quilted white satin, and trimmed with
black velvet and jet, and fastened around the waist with a
black silk cord and tassels. She seemed no worse for her
long season of fashionable dissipation, but looked stately,
blooming and beautiful as ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander arose and greeted her with more than usual
empressement, and led her to a seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>The breakfast was served. And the general telling Alexander
that it would do quite as well for a luncheon, invited
him to sit down to the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>While lingering over the late morning meal, they talked
of the just closed session of Congress and season of fashion,
and the general again pressed Alick to join his party at old
Lyon Hall. And in the presence of his beautiful betrothed,
Alick could neither refuse nor hesitate to accept the invitation.
So he gave his promise to accompany his uncle and
cousin to their home.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the breakfast was finished, and the service was removed,
the general arose, saying that he would go down into
the reading-room and look over the morning papers, he left
the parlor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander and Anna were alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At last, then, I have the opportunity of speaking to
you, that I have so long desired,” whispered Alick, as he
went and took a seat on the sofa, by the side of his
betrothed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>She received him very quietly, if not coldly.</p>

<p class='c011'>He then went on to lament the repeated interruptions
that had so long delayed their union, and to press her to
name an early day for the wedding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your great haste is of very late date, Alick. I saw no
signs of such impatience, until within the last few weeks,”
she answered coolly.</p>

<p class='c011'>He gave her a deprecating look, and pleaded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My love was chilled and my pride was hurt by your
marked preference for my rival.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush!” said Anna, quickly. “Let poor Dick alone.
He is honest, if he is wild. I have sent him away. Let
him go in peace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just so! Let him go. But you will grant my
request?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no wish to break off our engagement, Alick. I
will not be the first woman of my race to break my pledged
word. I will give you my promised hand; but not as soon
as you ask. Let the year of mourning end first.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will be in November.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; you must wait until then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander heaved a deep sigh, and got up and walked
the room, and looked a great deal more disappointed than
he felt.</p>

<p class='c011'>In truth—now he knew that his hand was free from legal
fetters to Drusilla, he felt that his heart was more bound to
her by affection than he had lately believed. And now his
hated rival was out of his way, he found that he was not
half so much in love with his beautiful cousin as he had
imagined.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so he really had no more desire to hurry the wedding
than had Anna herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>He wanted more time to break with her whom he had so
long taken for his wife. And as he walked up and down
the floor, he was thinking most of her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“Poor little Drusa,” he thought. “Good little Drusa,
from this hour she must be to me, only as a dear little sister.
But our parting must not he abrupt. Such a shock
would be her death-blow, poor child! Little by little I
must leave her. This trip to the old hall will be a good
start. She need not know where or why I go. I can tell
her that this business connected with my father’s will, takes
me into Virginia for a while—and this will be true, so far
as it goes. After a few weeks I will return to her, but
only as a brother, and will stay with her but a few days.
And then the second absence shall be longer than the first,
and the second return to her, shorter. And so, gently, most
gently will I loose the tie that binds her to me, so that
when the final parting comes, she shall scarcely feel it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So, as falsely as wickedly, he reasoned. For it would
have been more merciful to have broken with her at once
than to leave her by degrees. Much kinder would be the
quick, sharp death-blow that should end her woe instantly,
than the slow, cruel torture that would as surely if not as
swiftly destroy her life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something of this truth seemed to strike his mind. He
groaned slightly. Then he began to comfort his conscience.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will provide for her,” he said to himself. “I will buy
that little estate for her. She can live there as a young
widow. She can——Oh, great Heaven, what a villain I
am growing to be! But I cannot help it. I cannot remarry
Drusilla because I am bound to Anna, and have been
bound to her for many years. So I cannot but do as I do.
I wonder if murderers can help killing, or thieves stealing?
Or if really I can help being the wretch I am?” And as
he mentally asked himself this question his face grew so
dark with pain and remorse, that Anna, who had been
watching him and who quite mistook his mood, laughed and
said:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“Why, Alick, one would really think, to see you, that
you take this matter to heart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I take the matter to heart much more than you believe,
Anna,” he answered, speaking, as had been his frequent
manner of late, true in the letter and false in the spirit of
his reply. Then lest his supposed disappointment should
cause her to relent and to fix an earlier day for their marriage
than would quite be convenient for him, he hastened
to add: “But let it be as you will, fair cousin. I will wait
with what patience I may until November.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna pouted, for although she was in no haste to marry
she felt affronted that Alick should yield the point so
readily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alick staid and dined with his uncle and cousin that day.
And after dinner he would have taken leave to go home,
but his uncle stopped him, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, indeed, my boy. This is the first evening since we
have been in Washington that I have had you all to myself,
and I mean to have the good of you. Every other
evening you have had to dance attendance on Anna to some
place of amusement. There is no place to go to this evening,
thank Heaven. And Anna is tired and is going to
rest, so you just sit down and play a game of chess with me.
Come, I will let you off at ten o’clock, but not a moment
before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Alexander sat down to the chess-board with his uncle
and played until ten o’clock; and then bade him good night,
and started for home.</p>

      <div class='line'>Hers is the love which keeps</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A constant watch-fire light,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a flame that never sleeps</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, Drusilla slept long and deeply, like one
much worn in mind and body. It was afternoon when she
opened her eyes. She saw Pina sitting by her side. At
first, she thought it was yet early in the morning, and that
she had awakened at her usual hour, and she wondered why
her maid should be watching by her bed; but in another
moment, memory returned and reminded her of all the
events of the day. And she thought of Alexander’s loving
kindness to her, and she smiled with delight. Then she
asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Mr. Lyon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is gone to town, ma’am,” answered Pina.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little lady’s face fell. Its gladness was all gone in
an instant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gone to town again, Pina?” she repeated in a sad
tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am, which he told me to tell you, as he was
unwillin’ compelled for to go, and which he would be sure
to come back very early,” said the girl, in her good nature;
adding a little to her master’s message.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! did he say that, Pina? Did he say he would
come back very early? Are you sure, Pina?” And the
little face brightened up again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure as sure, ma’am; which ‘very early’ was his very
words,” said Pina, telling a little white lie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What time is it now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Near five, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>“Then he will soon be here,” she said. And strengthened
by this hope, she threw off the counterpane, and got
out of bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the help of her maid she dressed herself as carefully
to please her husband’s taste, as a maiden might to
attract a lover’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she went down stairs to see if the drawing-room
was made comfortable for the evening. She found that
Leo had done his duty in the matter. The fire in the
grate was burning brightly; the hearth was shining
clearly; the deep sofa was drawn up on one side of the
chimney, and the easy chair on the other, and the round table
was placed between them. The front blinds were
left as usual unclosed until the master’s return; but the
crimson curtains were drawn before the windows. The
chandelier was lighted, and its rays were reflected back
by the pictured walls, the gilded mirrors and the glowing
draperies of the room, so that the little retreat looked very
cozy and home-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, this is all very well; but there are no flowers,”
said this loving little wife; (for wife we must call her, notwithstanding
Mr. Alick’s discovery;) and she went into
her small conservatory and cut a few fragrant tea roses and
lemon geraniums, and arranged them in a beautiful group,
and placed them in a vase, and set them on the round
table.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then she opened her piano and selected from her
music some of her husband’s favorite pieces, and laid them
in readiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is so fond of music, and he likes my voice and
touch, and yet he so seldom hears me sing or play now.
Perhaps he will to-night, though,” she said, as she sat
down to try the tone of her long neglected instrument.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had taken no food since morning, for in fact, her
long sleep had kept her from feeling the want of it; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>soon she felt faint from hunger, and she got up to ring the
bell for a cup of tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Pina, who had not forgotten her mistress’s needs,
was even now on her way to the drawing-room with the
tea tray.</p>

<p class='c011'>She brought it in and sat it down on the table, and stood
waiting orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did your master say he would be home to dinner,
Pina?” the little lady asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, ma’am; he said ‘very early’ to <i>me</i>. And when
Leo asked him if dinner should be prepared for him, he
said ‘no,’ and that he should ‘be home to an early tea,’”
the girl replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, here; I will only take half a cup of that oolong
and half a biscuit to keep me up till he comes, for I wish
to take tea with him this evening,” said the little wife, as
she hastily took the bit and sup she spoke of.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, take this down, Pina; and listen,” she added, as
she pushed away the tray. “Have a very nice tea got
ready—the oolong and the imperial, mixed half and half as
he likes it; and make some sweet muffins; and slice that
venison tongue; and open those West India sweetmeats,
especially the preserved green figs and the pineapples. Do
you hear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And will you remember all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, madam, I will be sure to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina left the room, and her mistress resumed her practising.</p>

<p class='c011'>She went over all his favorite pieces in turn, stopping at
the end of each to go to the window, and watch and listen.</p>

<p class='c011'>But hour after hour passed by, and still he for whom she
looked came not. As night deepened, her spirits sank.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps he will not come at all,” she said, with a sigh.
“Something keeps him that he cannot help,” she added, in
excuse for him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>When the clock struck ten she could hardly keep back
her tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will not be home until very late, even if he comes
to-night,” she said, with a deep sob, as she closed the piano
and sat down by the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>She waited then for her servants to come as usual for
orders, before bidding her good night. Then, as they did
not appear, she rang for them.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when Pina entered, her mistress said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is long past your bed time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it, madam; but master, he gave us such a
rowing for leaving you alone last night, after you had been
frightened the night before, that Leo and me, we daren’t
go. We’ll sit in the kitchen, if you please, ma’am, or wait
in the hall, as you order, until the master returns.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He may not be able to get home to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, please, ma’am, we’ll have to sit up and watch, or
sleep anywhere in the house as you’ll appoint.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla reflected for a moment, and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may sit up in the kitchen for an hour longer, and
then come to me for orders.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl left the room, and her mistress sank back in her
resting chair, repeating to herself,</p>

<p class='c011'>“He knows that I am ill and nervous, and almost unprotected
here; and he left me word he would be back early.
Oh, surely he will keep his promise, in part, at least, by
coming back some time to-night. He will if he can! I
am sure he will, if he can!” she added, confidingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as the next hour wore slowly on, her long tried courage
utterly broke down, and she bowed her head upon the
table and wept bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The clock was striking eleven, when two sounds from
opposite ways struck her ear. One was the galloping of a
horse’s feet coming to the house. The other was the running
of her servants up the back stairs.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Drusilla hastily wiped her eyes as Pina entered the
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your master has come. Send Leo around to the stable
to take his horse, and do you bring up the supper-tray,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the girl left the room to obey orders; but before
going down stairs she went and unlocked the front door,
and set it slightly ajar, that her master might enter at once
when he should reach the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla meanwhile tried to still the spasmodic sobs that
were yet heaving her bosom, and to force back the tears
that were yet wetting her eyes, and to put on a pleasant
face to meet her beloved. But it is not so easy all at once
to suppress nervous excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>So when Alexander hurried through the hall door, locking
it as he passed, and hurried into the drawing-room to see
her, she was still sobbing and weeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped short in surprise and some anger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Drusa! why, what is all this row about?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, Alick!” she gasped, her nerves being all
unstrung, “I did not think you would have stayed away
from me to-night! I have been waiting for you so long, as
I have waited for you so often! oh, so often!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that meant for a reproach, Drusilla?” he asked,
coldly, as he dropped into a chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, Alick! no dear, no! but I can not—can not
help it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she cried harder than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, this is a pretty way to meet a man, upon my
word, after he has taken a long cold ride to see you,” said
Mr. Lyon, angrily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t mean it, Alick! Indeed I didn’t, dear! I
tried hard to help it; but I couldn’t. I broke down,” she
cried, sobbing heavily between her words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph, this is pleasant, upon my soul,” he said, grimly,
watching her without making one attempt to soothe her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“I know—I know how bad it is in me to do so, Alick
dear, and I’m trying to stop it; indeed I am. Bear with
me a little, dear; I will stop soon, indeed I will,” she
sobbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope it will be very soon. This looks very much as
if you were accusing me of misusing you, Drusilla; do you
mean to say that I do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, no, no, Alick! I never even thought so! You
are very good to me. It is not your fault, dear; it is mine.
I don’t know what ails me that I cry so much at such little
things. I feel like a baby that wants its mother’s lap,”
she said, with a still heaving bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is very childish, Drusilla,” he answered, in a
harsh, unsympathizing manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it is, dear. I am sorry I am so foolish; it is
because I am so, so lonely, Alick. Oh, so lonely, dear, you
can’t think; it is like death—like heart-break. But it is
not your fault, dear; I don’t mean that; don’t you think
that. You are not to blame, Alick; it is I. But then,
dear, think of this, and bear with me a little. I have no
one in the wide world but only you; and when you are
away all is so still, so silent—oh, so dreary you don’t know.
If I only had a mother to turn to when I feel so weak and
foolish, and so lonesome—if I could only lay my head down
on my mother’s shoulder when you are away, and cry a
little I should be better; I should be all right when you
should return home. But I have no mother to go to,
Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you had she would box your ears for such nonsense;
that is, if I remember the old lady rightly,” said Alexander,
brutally, as he arose from his chair and walked the
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>But her nervous excitement was now subsiding. Her
tears ceased to flow; her sobs were softer. Presently she
wiped her eyes, and, smiling like sunshine through raindrops,
she said:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“It is all over now, Alick dear, all quite over. It was
only a summer gust, dear, and it did me no harm; and you
will excuse it this once, Alick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall hardly know how to do so if this exhibition is
ever to be repeated,” he growled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope it never will be, Alick,” she said, with a subsiding
sigh, as she arose and touched the bell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, if you knew as much as I do you would very
carefully avoid giving me any annoyance,” he said, in so
meaning a manner that her hand dropped from the bell-pull,
and she turned to him in dismay, and, gazing on him,
asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it that you know, Alick, dear? Indeed I
never wish to annoy you. But what is it you mean,
dear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No matter! You will know some day; all too soon
whenever that day shall come,” he said, evasively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Alick dear, you frighten me. Please what is
it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No matter what. Let the subject drop, Drusilla,” he
replied, repenting the cruelty that made him allude to the
guilty secret of his own breast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, dear Alick——” she re-commenced.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let the subject drop, I say,” he interrupted her, in a
tone so peremptory that she immediately bowed her head
and obeyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Pina now entered the room with the tray, and laid
the cloth for supper. And having done so she retired.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Mr. Lyon had supped to his satisfaction, and felt
himself in a better humor, he turned around to the blazing
fire, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have a mind to sit up and watch to-night for that
face at the window”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do, dear Alick, if you are not too tired,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I will sit with my revolver by my side.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“Yes, do; and with me also.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you are not able to sit up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I am. You know I slept nearly all day. And
I do wish to watch with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So be it then. But we must draw the curtains back
from the windows, as they were last night and all nights
before. Who closed them to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leo did, I suppose, to keep the face from looking in
and frightening me again. And I did not change the arrangement,
because I reflected that you could see the light
almost as well through these fine crimson curtains as
glass itself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is true. It is a pity you or one of your servants
had not thought of this before. It would have saved you a
fright.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Alick, dear, if any dangerous person were lurking
about the premises, is it not better that I should have
detected him, even at the cost of a fright, than that he
should be let to go on and do the mischief he is plotting,
whatever that is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is something in what you say, my brave little
wi—woman,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not perceive how he caught and corrected his
words, for she was busy drawing back the curtains of one
window, while he did the like with those of the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander went and got his small revolver from the pocket
of his riding coat and laid it on the table beside him. And
then they sat down to wait the issue.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first they talked a little in low voices. Alexander
would make Drusilla tell him again and again the particulars
of her two frights. But she had so little to tell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only a white stern face, looking in at me through the
dark window.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander questioned her as to the hour of its appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“It was at two o’clock on the first night. And at one
o’clock on the second night,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly; and if it keeps on coming an hour later each
night, it will appear at twelve precisely to-night. And it
now wants just ten minutes to that time,” said Alexander,
with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he questioned her as to her thoughts, feelings and
occupations at the time she saw the face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla replied that she was reading, and confessed that
she was thinking of supernatural beings and feeling a little
afraid of looking over her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Precisely; and now let me ask you <i>what</i> were you reading?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had been reading ‘The Night Side of Nature,’” replied
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Alexander, “the secret is out!
The face at the window was an optical illusion created by
your over-excited imagination. Next time, my little love,
read Scott’s ‘Demonology.’ It will be a perfect antidote to
the ‘Night Side of Nature.’ I don’t wonder, poor child!
that you were afraid to look over your shoulder, or that you
saw faces glaring at you through dark windows. I wonder
you didn’t see a spectral face grinning through every single
pane of glass. Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! ha! ha!” echoed another voice—a strange, harsh,
unearthly voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander started and looked at his companion, who was
pale as death.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Ha! ha! ha!</i>” shouted the voice again.</p>

<p class='c011'>He then seized his revolver and turned quickly to the
window whence the voice seemed to come.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Ha! ha! ha!</span>” it shrieked a third time, as Alexander
caught a glimpse of a ghastly, grinning face that
showed itself for an instant at the window, and he levelled
his pistol. But as he fired it, it dropped and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“Stay here while I search the grounds,” whispered Mr.
Lyon to his panic-stricken companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>And revolver still in hand, he ran out of the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla sat with her hands clasped tightly together, her
face white as a sheet and her heart half paralyzed with
fright. She had not long to wait. A pistol shot, followed
by another and another in quick succession, startled her.
With a wild cry she sprang to her feet and rushed out to
the help of her husband.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Alick! Alick! Oh, Alick, where are you? Answer
me! Speak to me, if you can! Oh, give me some sign
where to search for you,” Drusilla cried, running wildly out
into the wintry night, in the direction from which she had
heard the shots, and fearing at every point to find her husband
dead or wounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush!” whispered a voice through the darkness. And
the next moment her husband stood by her side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, thank Heaven you are alive and safe! You
<i>are</i> safe, are you not, dear?” she eagerly inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but that infernal villain has got off!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, never mind, so that you are not hurt. You are <i>not</i>
hurt, are you, Alick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I have not been in any danger; but that cursed
caitiff! he has escaped!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>“Oh dear, let him go; so you are sure you are not
wounded? You <i>are</i> sure, are you not, dear? You are
quite sure neither of those shots struck you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The shots were fired by my own hand, and I’m only
sorry they missed their mark, and that diabolical scoundrel
got off! He ran like a quarter horse, Devil fly away with
him! I would have given a thousand dollars to have him
here with my foot on his neck! By all I hold sacred, I
would!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh Alick, do stop thinking about him, and think about
yourself! You are so excited I don’t believe you know
whether you are wounded or not; you may be bleeding to
death now, somewhere under your coat! Oh Alick, dear,
come in the house and let me look.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is you who are excited, little goose. You are shaking
like an ague! Come in the house yourself, and get warm
and quiet,” he said, tucking her under his arm and leading
her towards the cottage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But Alick, dear, tell me, are you <i>very</i> certain—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I’m not ‘<i>very</i>’ certain; I’m only just <i>certain</i> that
I have not a single scratch. That—that—miserable miscreant
was unarmed, I suppose, Satan burn him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who was he, Alick, do you know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How should I? I only know that he was some felon
spy, who has doubtless been hanging about the house, and
peeping through the windows o’ nights.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A spy, Alick? Only a spy? Why I thought he was
a robber and a murderer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My little love, a spy is the most dangerous character
of the three. We may defend ourselves against robbers
and murderers; but not against spies. The first are beasts
of prey; but the last are venomous serpents—snakes in the
grass. No one knows how long that infamous wretch has
been lurking around our house, or how often he has been
peeping in at our windows, or how much he has seen.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“Dear Alick, we have only seen <i>him</i> three times.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But he may have seen us, three hundred times. Of
course our eyes were not always on the window.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is true; but, after all, what of it, Alick? He
could not harm us by looking at us,” said the honest young
creature, who knew she had nothing to hide.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ugh! if I had him under my feet, I would not leave a
whole bone in his body!” cried the double-dealing man,
who was conscious that he had a great deal to conceal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, never mind, Alick, dear. For my part, I am well
content that the man got off, and you have no broken bones
to account for. For, after all, he committed no great crime
in looking in at a lighted window at night. Why, Alick,
in walking through the streets of the city in the evening
you and I used to do the same thing, only for the harmless
pleasure of looking in to an interior, upon a pretty domestic
picture of a family circle around their tea-table, or something
of the sort. And this man might have had no worse
purpose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“His purpose, whatever it might have been, should have
cost him his life if I had caught him!” said Mr. Lyon,
grimly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I am truly glad you did not catch him. Oh, be
content, Alick, for you may be sure, now that the man has
been seen and chased, he will never come to trouble us
again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know that he will. But he didn’t seem to
dread being seen, however. It was his taunting laugh, you
know, that drew my notice to him. He seemed to try to
catch my eye by mocking my laugh. I think he had seen
all he wished to see, and that this was to be his last visit;
so he let his presence be known, to annoy us. Ah! if I
ever find out who he is, he shall pay dearly for his frolic!”
exclaimed Alick.</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time they reached the house and entered it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Alexander made Drusilla sit down in the easy chair
before the fire, and then he went and carefully closed and
fastened the doors and windows, and finally came and took
a seat by her side.</p>

<p class='c011'>And they sat there a little while to warm and rest themselves
before going up stairs to bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick,” said Drusilla, “I hope if you ever do find out
who that man is, you will do him no harm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will be his death,” exclaimed Alexander, grinding his
teeth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, no; he may have been some poor forlorn creature,
who having no home of his own, looked in upon ours,
as upon a paradise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was, more likely, some vulgar wretch, who in prowling
about here at night, after game, has found out that a
very pretty little woman lives here, often all alone, and has
made up his mind to get as many peeps at her as he can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is the secret, now I come to think quietly over the
matter, my dear; and your brilliantly lighted windows
were the beacons that first drew him here to gaze on you at
will; to feast his eyes on your beauty; perhaps to fall in
love with you! Come, what do you think of it all now?”
inquired Mr. Lyon, maliciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, Alick, don’t talk so to me. I am your wife.
Such thoughts——” She paused, and blushing deeply,
turned away her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter, little love?” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You should not breathe such thoughts to me, dear
Alick. But—I shall draw the curtains before the windows
every evening in future.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think it would be just as well you should do so. The
light shining through their crimson folds will be enough to
guide me home at night,” he said, as he arose and lighted
the bedroom candles.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>She set the guard up before the grate, and put out the
lamps.</p>

<p class='c011'>They left the drawing-room and went up stairs together;
but when they reached their chamber door, he put one of
the candles in her hand, saying kindly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good night, my dear child. I hope you will have a
good sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And before she could answer, he opened the door of an
opposite chamber, passed in and locked it behind him,
leaving her standing still in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the first time, while at home, that he had ever
slept out of their mutual room. She could not imagine
why he should do so now. If he had not spoken so kindly
to her, she might have supposed he was angry with her.
But his good night had been even unusually gentle and
tender; it had seemed almost plaintive and deprecating.
But then he had not only passed their chamber and gone
into another room, but he had locked the door behind him,
thus securing himself against possible intrusion. Whose
intrusion? she asked herself—hers, his wife’s? Well, she
was his wife, she thought; but dearly as she loved him,
scarcely living, except by his side, she would never intrude
upon his chosen solitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>She stood there in perplexed and painful thought, inquiring
and wondering why he left her and locked her out.
Perhaps, after all, she said to herself, he was still a little
angry with her, for having cried so much that evening.
She must find out. She could not go to rest, she would
never be able to sleep without knowing whether he was
really displeased with her, and reconciling him to herself.
She would not intrude upon him, she thought, no, never!
But she would rap at his door and ask if she had offended
him, and if so, she would do all that she could to atone for
such offence. For she must make friends with him before
she left the spot, or—die!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>So she went and rapped at his door and then waited.</p>

<p class='c011'>She heard him moving about the room, but he made no
response.</p>

<p class='c011'>She thought he had not heard her, so she rapped again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! Who is there?” he inquired from within.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is I, your little Drusa, Alick,” she answered, in a
low and tremulous tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you want, Drusilla?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick dear, my heart is breaking; please don’t
be mad with me,” she pleaded, in her most plaintive voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not mad with you, child; why should you think
so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, I thought—I thought you were displeased,
because—because—” She could not go on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What reason could I have for being angry with you,
child?” he asked again, putting his question in a form that
he thought she could more easily answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, my crying so much this evening,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, bosh! that is all over now. No, little Drusa, I
have no cause, no just cause of complaint against you. If
I am ever angry with you, it is from my own quick temper,
and by no fault of yours, my child. Now go to bed like a
good girl, or rather like a sweet little saint as you truly are.
Good night, my little Drusa,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good night, dear Alick,” she answered, turning sadly
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>She went to her own room and set the candle on the
mantle-piece, sank into her easy chair, and lapsed into sorrowful
thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He said he was not angry with me; yes, he said so; but
he never told me why he left my room, and he never even
opened the door to speak to me, nor yet kissed me good night.
No, he is not angry with me; not angry, but sick
and tired of me, as I might have known he would be; for
what am I to please him who has been used to ladies of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the highest rank and culture? Yes, he is sick and tired
of me, and it is not his fault—it is mine; and I wish,
oh, I wish, it were no sin to die!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she dropped her head upon the arm of her chair
and wept bitterly; wept till she was so exhausted that she
slipped from the chair to the carpet, and, grovelling there,
wept on.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her tears like her grief, seemed inexhaustible; for, when
the daylight dawned and the sun rose, she was still lying
where she had sunk overcome with sorrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length when the morning was well advanced, she
remembered her housewifely duties, and slowly got up and
rang the bell for her maid.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, lest her evening dress should excite the girl’s curiosity,
as it did on a former occasion, she quickly took it off
and threw around her a chamber wrapper.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina came in and put fresh logs on the fire, and filled
the ewers, and laid out clean towels, and then stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is nothing more, Pina; you may go,” said her
mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the maid left the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla bathed her eyes and face, and combed her hair,
and dressed herself as tastefully as if she had slept through
a happy night and waked to a gladsome morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>And she went down stairs to see to the breakfast. The
cozy drawing-room, the bright fire, the clean hearth, the
neat table, all the accessories of her sweet home, and, above
all, the clear sunshiny morning, early harbinger of spring,
cheered her spirits and inspired more hopeful thoughts than
had been hers on the evening previous.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick loved me from my childhood,” she said, “and
chose me freely for his wife from all others that he might
have had. And he is very good to me. He spoke gently
to me even last night. Perhaps he is not so weary of me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>as I think. Perhaps he loves me still. And my doubts
come only from my own fancies. Oh, Heaven grant that it
may be so. I will see how he will meet me this morning.
But, oh! if I should be so keen to note every word and
look that he gives me, or don’t give me, how ill I should requite
his love. Shall I turn jealous fool, and watch my
Alick as if he were a foe to be suspected, and not my dear
husband to be loved and trusted to the last? No, Alick,
dear, no; I will do you no such wrong. I know I’m a big
little fool, but not such a one as that, either. What if he
did leave me last night. Perhaps he needed to be very
quiet, after so much excitement as he has had these two
nights. I am sure, I am so nervous sometimes that I cannot
bear a movement or a ray of light in my room, and why
should he not be subject to the same moods, even if he is a
strong man? Come, I will trust my husband, as well as
love him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This reaction of feeling, brought about mostly by the
blessed sunshine of morning and the benign influence of
home, called back the color to the young wife’s cheeks
and the light to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander came down earlier than usual. And she
arose from her seat to receive his morning kiss.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she did not get it. He passed her, and dropped into
his chair, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ring for breakfast, Drusa. I must get off to town
sooner by an hour this morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a suppressed sigh, she pulled the bell; and when
Pina appeared, she ordered breakfast to be served immediately.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander was thoughtful even to gloom. He had to
break to Drusilla the news of his intended sudden departure.
And he dreaded to do it, and he did not know how to
begin.</p>

<p class='c011'>The morning meal was served. They sat down to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>table. Drusilla poured out the coffee, and, in handing her
husband his cup, she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not feeling well this morning, Alick, dear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Drusa, I am not well, in spirits at least. I have a
very painful duty before me, little Drusa,” he answered,
catching at this opening for his discourse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very sorry, Alick,” she replied, and then waited
for his further speech.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be obliged to leave home for a short time. I
did not like to tell you last night, lest it should disturb
your rest,” he said, little knowing how utterly his desertion
had deprived her of that rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, dear, must you really go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must really go, Drusilla. That business connected
with my father’s will obliges me to do so,” he gravely said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall you take me with you, Alick?” she asked, in a
low, timid voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Drusa; of course not. If I could take you along
I should not feel so badly about going,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, I am so sorry, dear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall not stay very long, Drusa. I shall come back
to you as soon as I possibly can, my child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know you will, Alick. Where do you go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Into Virginia, of course, where our estates lie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what a troublesome business that is connected with
your father’s will, to be sure—to bother you so much as it
has ever since we have been married. Why cannot lawyers
make wills so clear that there can be no mistake about
their meaning?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, why indeed?” repeated Mr. Lyon, laughing in
spite of his secret self-reproach.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When do you start, dear Alick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To-morrow morning, my child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So soon! Oh, that is very sudden!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“These matters admit of no delay, Drusa. Now, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>little woman, don’t look so downcast. It is unpleasant
enough for me to have to leave you. Don’t add to my
vexation by your looks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Alick, I will not if I can help it. You will want
your clothes got ready,” she added, cheerfully, “and the
time is short. Tell me at once, please, what you would
like to take with you, and I will pack them up to-day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, a dozen of each sort of under-garment; one morning
and one evening suit; my dressing-case and writing-case;
those are all, I think. Have them put into the little
black Russia leather trunk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will pack them myself, Alick dear, and then they will
be sure to be done right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As you please, little woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How long shall you be gone, Alick? Can you tell me
that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, not exactly. The length of my absence depends
upon circumstances. Not more than a week or ten days at
most.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At least you will be sure to be back within the fortnight?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, certainly. But you know we can talk over all
this to-night, when I get back from town. I shall certainly
be home to tea,” said Mr. Lyon, as he arose from
the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I shall hope to see you. And I know you will
come if you <i>can</i>, Alick,” she answered, as she thought of
her constant disappointments in this respect.</p>

<p class='c011'>He understood her, and he answered, as he drew on his
riding-coat:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I <i>can</i> be back this last evening, and I <i>will</i>. Good-bye
until I see you again, little Drusa.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he put on his hat and hurried out of the house,
pulling on his gloves as he passed.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the next moment he mounted his horse and galloped
away.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Drusilla went to her own room, wept a little, and
blamed herself for that weakness, and then she called her
maid to help her, and she spent the whole day in preparing
her husband’s wardrobe for his journey.</p>

<p class='c011'>It happened for once that Mr. Lyon could keep his word
to his wife without much personal inconvenience, and so he
kept it.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he reached the city that day he made a morning
call upon his uncle and his cousin. He found the General
was engaged to dine that evening with a veteran brother
officer, and Miss Lyon would be occupied with the preparations
for her journey, so that neither the old gentleman nor
the young lady would be at liberty to entertain him longer
than the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>After lunching with his relatives, and arranging to join
them at nine the next morning, he bade them good day.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went to his own hotel where he called for his bill,
settled it in full, gave up the keys of his rooms, and so
closed his connection with the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the hotel he went to the livery stable, mounted his
horse and rode homeward.</p>

<p class='c011'>He reached Cedarwood at seven o’clock. He found his
trunk ready packed, corded and labelled for his journey,
and standing in the hall. He found the drawing-room as
cozy and inviting as his wife always made it for his reception;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the fire burning brightly, and the tea-table standing
before it spread with all the dainties he most liked; and,
above all, he found <i>her</i>, pretty, well-dressed, and cheerful as
she could command herself to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the first time for many weeks that he had taken
tea with his wife, and she made it a festive occasion. He
began again to realize that he loved her; he felt like pressing
her to his heart as in the first days of their marriage,
before the witchery of the world came between them, or he
had discovered what he supposed to be the illegality of their
marriage. Yes, he would have liked to have shown her
these proofs of reviving affection; but he did not. He had
decided, in the secrecy of his own insane mind, that she
was henceforth to be only as a sister to him until he should
be able to part with her entirely; and so he treated her now
very gently but very coldly.</p>

<p class='c011'>After tea, which he took care should be prolonged as far
into the evening as possible, he asked her to sing and play
for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>And she very gladly sat down to the piano, and executed
some of his favorite pieces in her very best style.</p>

<p class='c011'>He purposely kept her there, playing piece after piece,
until she was really wearied.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then when she rose from the instrument he took the
lead in the conversation, and would talk of nothing but
music, musicians, and composers until the clock struck
eleven. Then he suddenly said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My little girl it is late, and you are tired; go to bed at
once. I have letters to write that will detain me an hour
or so. When I have finished them I will come up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick, dear, letters to write so late to-night when you
have to start so early to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, little Drusa.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why didn’t you write them earlier in the evening,
then?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“Because I wanted to enjoy every moment of your company
while you sat up, Drusa, and I knew I could write
them after you had retired,” he artfully replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I had rather not leave you at all this last evening,
Alick. I will sit very quietly near you and not interrupt
you the least while you write your letters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I will not permit you to do so, Drusa. You are
pale with want of rest even now; and you will make a
point of getting up to-morrow morning even sooner than I
shall—I know you will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must, Alick dear, to see that you have a good breakfast
ready in time to eat it leisurely before you go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just so; therefore you must go to rest now. There, be
a good girl, and clear out, will you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Alick,” she answered, in a depressed tone.
“Good night;” and she put up her lips to kiss him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bosh! no good night in the case. Do you think I am
going to sit up till day writing letters?” he said, laughing
and evading her caress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feeling that something was very wrong, yet trying not
to think so, she left the room and went up stairs to bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>And after a little while, being almost worn out by so
many nights’ watching, she fell asleep and slept until
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, Alexander wrote a couple of trifling letters,
and then, not to disturb her, he stole on tip-toes up to his
newly chosen room and went to rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla was the first up in the morning, before even her
servants were astir. She roused Pina and set her to work,
and helped with her own hands, and to such good purpose
that a very nice breakfast was soon ready and waiting for
Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>He came down, and greeted Drusilla kindly, but without
his usual morning kiss. And she felt the slight; but
neither spoke nor looked her chagrin.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“You were so still that I thought you were asleep when
I went up stairs last night, so I took care not to wake you
by entering your room; for you needed rest very much,
little Drusa,” he said, in explanation of his second desertion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Alick,” she answered, quietly; and she went on
to make his coffee.</p>

<p class='c011'>When breakfast was over there came a hurried leave-taking.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander pulled on his riding-coat in great haste; drew
on his gloves and then looked at Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” he muttered to himself, “she is henceforth only
like my sister; but I should embrace my sister before leaving
her to go on a journey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you saying, Alick dear?” inquired Drusilla,
who caught the sound, but not the import of his
words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing. Good-bye, my little Drusa, my darling little
Drusa,” he said, folding her to his bosom and kissing her as
no man ever kissed his sister yet, and as he had not kissed
<i>her</i> for many weeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do love me then, after all, don’t you, Alick?” she
said, in delight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Love you! I think I do, little darling! But now I
must tear myself from you, Drusa. You will find in my
glass drawer a roll of bank-notes amounting to between five
and six hundred dollars, for your use while I am gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, I shall never want the tenth part in so short
a time as a fortnight; and you are to be home in a fortnight,
are you not, Alick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, surely. Now then, good-bye!” he hastily
exclaimed, giving her another tight hug and long kiss.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will write soon, Alick?” she said, following him
to the front door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very soon.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“But I shall want to write to you every day, beginning
this evening. Where shall I direct the first letter, Alick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the post-office at Richmond.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you will find one from me in Richmond the day
after you get there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, my darling! Thank you, pet! Good-bye!
Good-bye! I have not an instant to lose,” he hurriedly
exclaimed, wringing her hand and jumping into the carriage,
upon which his luggage was already placed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo, who was in the driver’s seat, cracked his whip and
started his horses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla watched the carriage out of sight, and then
turned sadly and went into the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander drove rapidly to the town, and first to a hack
stand, where he had his luggage taken and put upon a
hack. Then he sent Leo back to Cedarwood with his carriage,
and he himself got into the hack and drove to his
uncle’s hotel, where he found the old gentleman impatiently
waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in an hour the whole family party had started on
their voyage, and were steaming down the Potomac on their
way to Richmond, where early the next morning they
arrived safely.</p>

      <div class='line in2'>For all its dearest, fondest schemes.—<span class='sc'>Moore.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The loving little wife, the zealous little housekeeper, did
not sit down in idleness and repining while her husband
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>was absent. Occupation was always her great resource
against melancholy.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was, besides, too much in sympathy with all nature
not to feel the influence of the vitalizing spring season,
with the reviving world around her.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun was shining with a more genial splendor; the
air was soft and warm; the ground was quickening with
the springing grass and the trees with the rising sap and
budding leaves. Birds were building their nests. All
things inspired thoughts of renovation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Drusilla resolved to refresh her pretty wildwood
home with a spring cleaning, so that it might possess new
attractions for its truant master, when he should please to
return.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not that her house required this—for it was already as
clean and sweet as it was possible for any dwelling to be;
and the process to which she subjected it was but the
washing of what was already pure, and the polishing of
what was already bright. But it was her maxim, as it had
been her mother’s before her, that things should not be
permitted to become soiled before they were cleaned; but
that they should be kept clean.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the course of this work Drusilla opened the drawer of
the looking-glass in Alexander’s dressing-room, and while
putting its contents in order she found that little piece of
paper which had produced so strange an effect upon his
feelings and actions. Thinking it to be only some little
receipt, or memorandum, she opened it and read it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Its effect upon her was very different from what it had
been upon her husband. As she gathered its meaning her
face softened with a sweet and tender smile, and she sat
down in a chair to contemplate it at more leisure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never saw this before; or any other of the sort.
How it brings back that day! that happy wedding-day!
the happiest of my life! Dear Alick! dear, dear Alick,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>how blest you made me that day, in making me your own
forever! forever and ever, my love! My joy seemed too
much for earth, too much to be real. Even now, even now,
I can scarcely realize how happy I am and ought to be!
Oh, my love! my love! I hope I may never give you an
uneasy moment as long as I live in this world! that I may
never cease to please and serve you all my days! Dear
little token!” she said, fondly gazing on that fatal piece of
paper—“I will keep you for his sake. When I am sad and
lonely I will look at you. I will cherish you like my
wedding-ring.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she went directly and made a little silk bag, put the
paper in it, attached it to a ribbon, hung it around her neck
and hid it in her bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then smilingly she resumed her work.</p>

<p class='c011'>When she considered the house thoroughly cleansed and
worthy of its summer hangings, she told Pina that crimson
satin curtains should not be put up again until autumn.</p>

<p class='c011'>And she ordered Leo to put the horses into the carriage
to take her to town.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the first occasion upon which she had left home
for many weeks. And she went now upon a shopping expedition,
to purchase white lace curtains for her windows,
and white linen to make summer covers for her crimson
satin chair and sofa cushions.</p>

<p class='c011'>She spent the whole forenoon in making her selections;
and then, feeling tired and hungry, she drove to a “Ladies’
Tea Room,” where she had once been with Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>She entered and sat down at one of the little tables and
asked for a cup of chocolate and some seed cakes, which
were soon brought.</p>

<p class='c011'>While she ate and drank she looked about her with the
curiosity natural to one who had lately led so secluded a
life. The room was half full of customers. At some of
the tables small family parties of parents and children were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>gathered. At others ladies and gentlemen were seated.
And at the table exactly opposite to her own there were two
officers and two young women who were dining and drinking
wine, laughing and talking, and conducting themselves
generally in a manner not agreeable to quiet and well-disposed
people.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla glanced at this noisy party but once, and recognized
the officers as the same who had intruded into her box
on the night she went to hear the German opera troupe.
Chiefly because the party were so ill-behaved, she was afraid
to look towards them again. So she drew her veil around
between the side of her face and her obnoxious neighbors,
and she looked down into her plate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Natural as this action was, it caught the attention of the
officers; and, innocent as it was, it gave umbrage to their
female companions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She sees that we recognize her,” said one of the men.</p>

<p class='c011'>And a low, derisive laugh came from one of the women.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very much abashed, and also a little alarmed, Drusilla
left her luncheon half consumed and went to the counter to
pay her bill.</p>

<p class='c011'>But one of the officers got up and followed her, and, as
she turned to leave the room, he placed himself before her,
and, lifting his hat, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you do, Miss?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla bowed in silence, and attempted to pass on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me, but when did you reach town?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon, sir; I have not the honor of your
acquaintance,” said Drusilla, coldly, passing him by and
quickly leaving the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he followed her out on the sidewalk, and joining her,
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You ‘have not the honor of my acquaintance,’ eh?
Well, the ‘honor’ is questionable, but the acquaintance is
beyond a doubt, my dear! What! don’t you remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the night I came into the box, to chaff my friend Lyon on
his pretty little acquisition, eh? By the way, how is
Lyon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time Drusilla had beckoned her servant, who
drove up with the carriage, dismounted, opened the door,
and let down the steps for his mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you didn’t tell me how my friend Lyon is. I hope
he is well. I know he has left his rooms at the hotel. But
if you will favor me with your address, Miss—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leo,” said Drusilla to her coachman, as she entered
her carriage, “this person annoys me. If you see a policeman
give him in charge, and—drive on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, madam,” answered the man, heartily, cracking his
whip and starting his horses.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the animals were not fresh, and they had not been
fed or watered since morning. So they did not move with
their usual spirit. And Drusilla had not gone far up
Seventh street road, on her way home, before she perceived
that she was followed by a hack that was gaining upon her
every moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first she supposed this following to be accidental; but
when the hack driving rapidly, caught up to her and might
have passed her, yet did not; but, on the contrary, slackened
its pace and kept just behind her; she suspected that
there was something more than accident in the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>And her suspicions were confirmed when she heard loud
laughing and talking in the hack, and recognized the voices
of the disreputable party who had insulted her in the tea
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>She quickly let down the little window in front of her
own carriage, and spoke to her coachman:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leo—drive fast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am, which it is necessary so to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are those people behind, Leo?” she breathlessly
inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>“A intoxified set, ma’am, which is unbeknown to me;
being always too well conducted to be acquainted with sich;
which I think one of um is the person you complained of,
ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes! go on quickly, for Heaven’s sake, Leo; let us
leave them behind as soon as possible,” hastily urged
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the young coachman put his jaded horses to their
utmost speed.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the horses in the hack were the fresher of the two
sets, and they kept well up behind her carriage until they
reached the gate of the private road leading through Cedarwood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Leo drew up his carriage, left his seat, opened the
gate, propped it back, and took the reins to lead his horses
through.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had but just cleared the gate, when Drusilla put
her head from the window and said, hastily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leo, stop just where you are! stop the way! Those
persons are preparing to follow us in. Tell them that they
can not be permitted to do so; that this is a very private
road leading to my own house, and no farther.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the first word Leo had stopped the carriage, thus barring
the way, and now he turned and spoke to the man who
was the ringleader of the party, and who had now left his
seat and was mounted beside the driver on the box.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, sir, this road leads to my mist’ess’s
house and no farther on,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, we know where it leads! We are going to make a
call there!” laughed the man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leo, Leo, do not let them pass, whatever you do,”
breathlessly whispered Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, sir, if you please, my mist’ess don’t receive no
strangers,” expostulated the servant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, we are not strangers! We know her very well!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>And we know Lyon, too! Come, clear the way, my man,
and let us pass.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, sir, my mist’ess don’t see no visitors of no sort,
neither strangers nor likewise acquaintances,” urged Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But she’ll see us!” laughed the man on the box.
And his laugh was loudly echoed by his companions inside
the hack.</p>

<p class='c011'>During this controversy Drusilla had sat back in her
seat, keeping as much out of sight as possible, and only
leaning forward when obliged to speak to her servant.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Leo had been artfully manœuvering his horses, with
a purpose that the party behind were too much confused by
intoxication to detect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, my man, get out of the way, will you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes sir, immediate!” answered Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he suddenly wheeled round the carriage, clanged to
the gate, and secured it in the face of the baffled pursuers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then with a loud derisive laugh, the boy sprang up into
his seat and drove off through the woods towards home.</p>

<p class='c011'>The discomfited party in the hack sent after him a volley
of oaths, that he continued to hear until distance made
them inaudible.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they reached Cedarwood, Drusilla got out of her
carriage more dead than alive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina met her and supported her into the house, while
Leo gave a hasty account of their adventure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Try to compose yourself, ma’am. Lor! I wouldn’t let
myself be upset by them rubbish!” said Pina as she held a
glass of water to her mistress’s lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who were they, Leo, and why did they pursue me?”
inquired Drusilla, when she was somewhat restored.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please, ma’am, I don’t know who they were, not being
beknown to sich. But they were all intoxified, the whole
lot of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why did they pursue me?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“Well, ma’am, they was on a lark, and seen you was
afeard of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was more in it than that, Leo! Do you think
they can get through the gate?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, ma’am; I locked it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But they can get out of the carriage and climb over
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, ma’am, they’re too tipsy. They can hardly sit in
their seats. The driver is the onliest sober one in the lot,
and he’ll take them away, you may be sure, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what a horrible, what a revolting set! Oh, that
such creatures should live in this world!” exclaimed Drusilla,
with a shudder. And she seemed to have forgotten
all her pretty, new purchases in which she had been so
much interested.</p>

<p class='c011'>But neither of her young servants had done so. And
Pina, in haste to bring the treasures in that she might have
a sight at them, and Leo in a hurry to get rid of them,
that he might take his horses round to the stable, went out
together.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina returned with her arms full of parcels.</p>

<p class='c011'>And soon Drusilla, who had laid off her bonnet, lost sight
of her late disagreeable adventure, in the pleasing occupation
of displaying her beautiful lace curtains to the admiring
eyes of her handmaid.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the next few days, mistress and maid were agreeably
employed in making up the curtains, and in cutting and
fitting the white linen chair covers.</p>

<p class='c011'>And by Saturday evening the curtains were put up, and
the chair covers put on, and the summer decoration of the
pretty wild wood home was complete.</p>

<p class='c011'>This brought the end of the first week of Alexander’s
absence. Drusilla was counting the days, and she knew
that if he should keep his word, he would be home by the
end of another week.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>She had written to him every evening, and sent the
letter to the city post-office every morning by Leo, who was
also instructed to inquire for letters for her. But as yet
she had had but one from Alick, and that one only announced
his safe arrival at Richmond, and acknowledged
the receipt of her first note. Since that she had not
heard from him. But she said to herself that he was very
much engaged, and could not be expected to write to her
more than once or twice a week. And so she comforted
her longing heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the two weeks of Alexander’s absence, Drusilla’s
health improved very much. The reasons were obvious.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place, the very tender leave he had taken
of her had revived her fainting faith in his love, while the
positive promise he had made her to return within the fortnight
had given her something certain to anticipate.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the second she no longer sat up night after night,
watching, waiting and weeping, in fatigue, suspense, and
even terror, that wore her nerves and wasted her strength
and tried her temper. She went to bed early, slept soundly,
and rose refreshed.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in the third, she had made a discovery that filled
her soul with joy. She knew now, for it was evident, even
to her ignorance and inexperience, that she was to be
blessed with the crowning blessing of woman’s life, maternity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once again, on the Monday of the second week of her
husband’s absence, she made a shopping expedition into the
city. And on this occasion she shut up the house and took
both her servants along—Leo to drive the carriage and
Pina to sit inside with her. She took a luncheon basket
too, that she might not be obliged to go into a refreshment
room at the risk of meeting her disagreeable acquaintances—although
reason assured her that there was not one
chance in a thousand of her seeing them under the same
circumstances again.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>This time Drusilla bought a quantity of fine flannel,
linen, cambric, muslin and lace, and also flaxen and silken
floss and Berlin wool for embroideries.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Pina, who had guessed the sweet domestic mystery
long before her child-like mistress had suspected it, was as
much interested in the purchase as their owner could be.
Drusilla returned home without any unpleasant adventure.
And the next day she commenced her delightful task. And
seated in her pleasant chamber, surrounded by her pretty
working materials, devising dainty little garments, and
anticipating the joys in store for her, she felt happy.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Drusilla received no second letter from Alexander.
On the day after his arrival in Richmond, he received
and answered her first one. Then he went with his uncle
and cousin down to Old Lyon Hall, where he lived very
quietly with them for about ten days, all the party resting
from their fashionable Washington campaign.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of that time, in order to keep the letter of
his promise to Drusilla, he pleaded urgent business, and
went up to Richmond, “for a day or two,” as he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>On reaching that city, he hurried to the post-office, where
he found nearly a dozen letters from Cedarwood awaiting
him. He did not stop to answer them; but took the first
train to Washington, and arrived in the capital the same
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>There was plenty of time for him to have gone out to
Cedarwood that evening. But, true to his plan of never
sleeping under the same roof with Drusilla again, if he
could help it, he stayed at one of the city hotels all night.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the morning, however, he hired a horse from a livery
stable and set out to visit his home.</p>

<p class='c011'>That day Drusilla had also risen very early, saying to
herself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is the last day of the fortnight, and Alick will be
home to-night. That is to say, if nothing happens to prevent
him—and surely there is nothing likely to happen—he
will keep his pledged word with me and return to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so she busied herself with affectionate preparations
for his arrival.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was nothing at all else that she could do to add to
the attractions of the lovely home she had renovated and
decorated for his comfort and pleasure. But there were
certain dainty dishes that always delighted his epicurean
taste; and these she had carefully prepared for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they were ready, she went up to her chamber and
sat down to the liliputian dress-making that was now the
sweetest task in the world to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was still early in the forenoon, being only ten o’clock,
and she was intently engaged upon a miniature embroidered
robe, when she heard the sound of horses’ feet approaching
the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not expecting that Alexander would return at this
unusual hour of the day, or in this manner, and supposing
that the noise arose from Leo exercising one of the horses
from the stable, she paid no attention to the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the next moment she heard the sound of a man’s
footsteps on the stairs, and the instant after the door was
thrown open and Alexander entered the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a cry of joy, she sprang up to meet him and fell
upon his bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>“Why are you so glad to see me as all this comes to, my
little Drusa?” he asked, remorsefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not answer him. In her excess of feeling, she
could not speak. But if he had come back from an absence
of two years instead of two weeks, her delight and excitement
could not have been greater.</p>

<p class='c011'>He kissed and embraced her very fondly—“as I should
if she were my sister,” perhaps he said to himself. And
then with gentle force he put her back in her chair, and
seated himself in another one near her, and put his arm
around her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick dear, I’m so glad—so glad to see you!” she
cried, as soon as she recovered her voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So am I to see you, little darling, especially when I see
you looking so well. How pretty you are; how much you
have improved!” he said, running his fingers through her
glossy tresses, and gazing admiringly upon her bright face,
with its flushed cheeks, parted lips, and eyes sparkling
through tears of joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, I am so happy to have you back again!”
she eagerly repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And yet it is very plain that you haven’t moped during
my absence; have you now, little one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no indeed, Alick; I have been so cheerfully busy
fixing up the place against you should come. The house
looks so fresh and pretty in its spring dress, Alick dear, I
am sure you will enjoy it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not fresher or prettier than the house’s mistress, and
I’m sure I shall like both,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall you, Alick? Are you sure that I shall be able to
please you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be my fault if you are not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now that the winter is over and the summer at hand,
it will be pleasanter here in the country, Alick. And the
grounds around this little place can be made very beautiful.
Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>“Yes, little Drusa. And I intend to spare neither
trouble nor expense in making this little estate a paradise
for my peri. An ideal spot it shall be; everything shall be
arranged according to your taste. The woods, since you
love them, shall environ the ornamented grounds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, dear! how good you are to me! But don’t
sacrifice utility to beauty for my sake, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Drusa! I would sacrifice a much greater thing
for your sake,” he said, with a very deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked up at him suddenly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are well, Alick? quite well, I hope?” were the
next words she addressed to him, as she gazed anxiously in
his care-worn face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not very well, little Drusa,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>And ah! who could be well with an evil conscience!</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is—nothing serious, dear Alick?” she inquired,
growing pale with fear for his health.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, little goose! only spring languor and the fatigue
of my journey,” he answered, with a laugh that reassured
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh; and perhaps you have not had breakfast,” she
exclaimed, hastily rising.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, I have,” he said, gayly, pushing her back in
her seat. “I had breakfast two hours ago. I don’t want
that, nor do I want lunch yet, so you need give yourself no
trouble about me for awhile.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But would you like to go to your dressing-room? All
is ready for you there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll warrant; but I made my toilet where I got my
breakfast, so I need not leave you even for that purpose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your luggage, Alick, have they brought it up?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no luggage; I came out on horseback.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, was that your horse I heard?” she inquired in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; didn’t you know it?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>“No; I thought you came in a cab.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I preferred the saddle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—how about your luggage, Alick dear? Shall I
call Leo and order him to take the carriage and go after it?
Where did you leave it? At the hotel where you breakfasted?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you inquisitive little imp! Sit down and be quiet
while I tell you. I brought very little luggage to Washington,
and that I left, as you surmise, at the hotel where I
breakfasted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then let me send Leo for it. He can go and return in
two hours,” she said, again starting up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a little fidget you are, to be sure! There is not
the least need to send for my things from the hotel. And
if you did but know what a little time I have to spend with
you, you would not be so eager to run away from me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These words had the desired effect. They prepared her
to hear his cruel announcement. She dropped into her
chair, and looking at him uneasily said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, dear, you are not going away again, are
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, my child; I shall be compelled to leave you again,
and very soon. Now listen to me and be reasonable, my
good little girl. I have kept my word and come back at
the time I said I would. Have I not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Alick,” she answered, in a low, meek voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, in order to keep my word with you, Drusa, I had
to leave my business and come off in a great hurry. Do
you understand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the state in which I left my affairs makes it absolutely
necessary for me to go back to Richmond immediately.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Alick dear; but you will stay with me a day or
two, at least?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>“No; I came only to keep my word with you. I must
go back this evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick!” she exclaimed in a tone full of grief, as
she let her work fall from her hands and gazed at him with
a look of despair that she could not control.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, come, little Drusa, do be rational, little girl!
See what an effort I have made to keep my word with you—dropping
my most important business at a critical juncture,
just to come home and see you. Now, really, I do
everything in the world I can to please you,” he said, so
earnestly that he almost persuaded even himself that he
did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, Alick, you do indeed; and you always have
done so. What should I be, but for your loving kindness?
A poor, desolate orphan, with no one to care for me! You
are very good to me, Alick, and you always have been so;
and I ought to be cheerful, as well as grateful, only I—cannot
always—and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>She could say no more; her voice broke into sobs, and
she dropped her face upon her hands and wept.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph, this is the thanks I get for travelling several
hundred miles express to see you. I have but a few hours
to spend with you, and you entertain me with tears! Very
encouraging to me to come again, I must say!” he angrily
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not reply; her whole form was shaking with
her convulsive sobs.</p>

<p class='c011'>He got up and walked about the room with his hands in
his pockets, and whistled an opera tune.</p>

<p class='c011'>She tried hard to suppress her sobs and to command her
voice, and when at length she succeeded in doing so, she
held out her hands imploringly towards him, and pleaded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive me, Alick. I could not help it, dear; indeed I
could not. It was because I loved you so. I love you so,
Alick!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>“Then I wish to the Lord you didn’t love me ‘so!’ that’s
all,” he brutally exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick!” she said, still holding out her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a cursed bore to be loved ‘so!’” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, you did not use to say so!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps I thought so, though! It’s an infernal nuisance
to be loved so, I tell you, and I’m tired of it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick, Alick, you used to make me tell you over and
over again how much I loved you. You used to say I
couldn’t love you too much, I couldn’t even love you
enough,” she murmured, dropping her pleading hands upon
her lap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bosh! I must have been a great spoon in those
days!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not reply to this, but again covered her face and
wept softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Besides,” continued this moral philosopher, “such love
as yours is—what do they call it in the prayer-books?—‘inordinate
affection.’ And inordinate affection is very sinful,
let me tell you, and will bring its own punishment.
Sooner or later you will suffer for it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I have, I have suffered for it, have I not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This wail came from her unawares, and the next moment
she was sorry for having let it escape her, sorry for the feeling
that prompted it; for she could not bear even in her
thoughts to blame one whom she worshipped so madly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if you have suffered, it is your own fault.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it, Alick—I know it; and I never meant to say
that it was yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then what in this world is the matter with you?
What do you need more than you have? Of what do you
complain?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of nothing, Alick—I complain of nothing. I am out
of my senses, I think.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think so too. Here you are in a position that would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>be envied by hundreds—yes, by thousands, by millions of
your sex, as the height of woman’s happiness. You have a
comfortable and even an elegant home; and I mean to
settle it on you also. You have a luxurious table, a splendid
wardrobe, attentive servants, horses, carriages—what in
the world <i>can</i> you want in addition to these?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only a little more of my husband’s company, Alick,”
she pathetically answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bosh! You are a Christian, or you profess to be one.
You read your Bible. Why don’t you go by it? St. Paul
says, ‘Having food and raiment, be therewith content,’ or
words to that effect. You have not only food and raiment,
but every comfort and luxury that money can buy. Why
cannot you be content?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, dear, ye! I have all <i>money</i> can buy. But
there are blessings that money cannot purchase. Oh, Alick,
I could be content with very much less of this world’s goods
than your wealth has given me; I could be happy with
very little food and raiment, if only I had more of your
society.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was weeping softly, with her head bowed upon her
hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was still walking up and down the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently she got up and met him with her hands held
out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not leave me, Alick, dear—oh, do not leave again so
soon. You have made me your wife, and I have no life
but in you—none, Alick, none! If you tear me from your
heart, I shall wither and die like a plant pulled up by the
roots. Oh, take me to your bosom again, for I have no life
out of you Alick—Alick—”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not in human nature, at least not in a young man’s
nature, to resist her beauty, her pleading; and he folded her
to his heart, covered her face with kisses, and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little Drusa! little Drusa! oh, my dear, dear child!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>what a misery for you that you should love me, wretch that
I am!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why, Alick? Why? It is my life—my very life!
and I have no other!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Drusa! Drusa! Good Heaven! How is this to
end! I wish from my soul you had never had the misfortune
of meeting me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, why do you say that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know!” he groaned. Then he answered
evasively—“I am utterly unworthy of you. I cause you
so much suffering.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But that comes of my weakness, not of your fault,
dear Alick. Besides I am happy now, very happy now
that I see you love me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little Drusa, did you ever doubt that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never doubted your faith, Alick. When you have
kept away from me, I have doubted my own worthiness of
your love.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My darling, if you were sure, entirely sure of my
affection, could you then bear that I should be absent from
you a great deal?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” she answered, honestly; “I couldn’t even live,
Alick. I couldn’t live away from you, any more than a
flower broken off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my soul! what will become of you, child? Better
with your strong affections, better you had died in your
infancy!” he muttered to himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter, Alick? What are you saying?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am thinking of you. Poor child! With your nature
you can never be happy in this world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes, I can, dear Alick! It takes so little to make
me happy. Only let me live with you and I ask no more
of earth, or Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My darling, I do believe, I do believe, if all other things
were conforming, you could also make me very happy,” he
said gravely and tenderly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>“I should try so zealously to do it, Alick. I would never
vex you with weeping or moping. Because you know I
never did weep for anything but your absence; and if I
might be with you I should never have cause to weep again.
If you must go back to Richmond, Alick, can’t you take me
with you? I could get ready in half an hour, or in less
time. And I wouldn’t be troublesome to you on the
journey, indeed I wouldn’t, dear. Say, will you take
me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My little Drusa, it is impossible. I should not be able
to stop in Richmond over twenty-four hours. I should
have to go into the country and travel from place to place,
on this vexatious business. But don’t look so despairing,
darling! I will not stay a day longer than I can help,” he
said, putting her gently from his arms, and throwing himself
down into a chair beside her work-table.</p>

<p class='c011'>She also resumed her seat. And she took up her needle-work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you amusing yourself with, little Drusa?
Dressing dolls?” he inquired, taking up and inspecting the
little, embroidered robe that lay upon her lap. “Is this for
a great doll!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Alick,” she answered, while a rosy blush and tender
smile of joy and embarrassment brightened her face. “It
is not for a great doll, it is for a little angel who is coming
to us soon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The d—l!” exclaimed Alexander, invoking his master
and guide.</p>

<p class='c011'>She heard him and looked up hastily in surprise and
pain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought you would be glad, Alick,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, hem, so I——If I’m not glad, it is for your sake,
Drusa,” he said, confusedly. Then, gathering more self-control,
he added: “You are very young, little Drusa, to
have the cares of maternity thrust upon you.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“Such sweet cares, Alick—not to be known from joys.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you are scarcely sixteen years old!—too young,
too young, Drusa.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if I was old enough to be a wife, dear, I am old
enough to be a mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are too young to be either, little Drusa.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You didn’t use to think so. Oh, Alick, I thought you
would be glad. I am sorry you are not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she folded her little robe up, and put it out of sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems I cannot open my lips without wounding you,
Drusa,” he muttered, moodily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t say that, Alick. Come, let us go down. I want
to show you how pretty the drawing-room looks. And I
want to show you the young birds—I mean the new broods
of canaries, hatched since you left,” she said, cheerfully,
rising.</p>

      <div class='line'>And he was gone, and like a funeral knell</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Suppressing all her mortification and sorrow at the cold
reception her husband had given her sweet news, Drusilla
took him through the renovated house and showed him all
its new improvements.</p>

<p class='c011'>As if to make up for the previous surliness, he admired
everything he saw and praised his little housekeeper for her
taste.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he said he would go to the stable and look at the
horses; and he asked her to get her bonnet and come with
him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>She ran up stairs, calling Pina to follow her. And while
she was putting on her thick shoes and her bonnet and
mantle, she gave the girl particular directions about the
dinner. For as Mr. Lyon had so short a time to stay,
Drusilla did not wish to leave him long enough to pay a
visit to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she went down stairs and joined her husband. And
they walked together to the stable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everything there was found in a satisfactory condition
and the horses were in fine order. Evidently Leo had
done his duty, as well as, or better than, so young a groom
could be expected to do it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Drusilla invited Alexander to walk through the
ground, that she might show him the new garden she had
laid out. And, as before, he expressed delight in all he
saw, and approbation of her skill as a landscape gardener.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You take so much pains to beautify this place, and find
so much pleasure in the task, that I hope you will be very
happy here, little Drusa,” he said, as they turned to go
back to the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be very happy here, or anywhere else, dear
Alick, when you have got through that troublesome business
and can come and stay at home with me,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>He shrugged his shoulders, but made no answer. She
did not see his questionable gesture, so she continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“For indeed, Alick, you and I live now more like mere
acquaintances than like a married couple. And you seem
less the master of the house than the occasional guest of the
mistress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed at this conceit, and then sighed as he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t see how it can be helped, little Drusa. I wish
it could be, in some way. Heaven knows how it pains me
to part with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mr. Alick thought of Joe Smith and the Mormon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Bible and wished that one had been a true prophet and the
other a divine revelation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear Alick, it is selfish in me, I know, but I am
glad it pains you to part with me; and I hope it may hurt
you so badly that you may not be able to stay away,” said
Drusilla, with a sweet smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, little Drusa! however distressing it may be to me
to absent myself from you, I must do so when duty requires
the sacrifice,” sighed Alexander, piously. Then, to change
the subject, he inquired—“You have seen nothing more of
the face at the window, little Drusa?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, nothing at all. But then the windows, since you
left, have always at nightfall been closed and curtained,” she
answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor heard anything of the man lurking about here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not a word.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor gained any clue to his identity?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, none.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you have not been annoyed by any such intrusion
since I left you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not by any.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very glad to hear it, little Drusa.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As he spoke she recollected the disorderly party who had
followed her carriage from the city; and thought that truth
required her to mention the circumstance, so she added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, yes. I didn’t write to you about it, because
I knew it would only make you anxious to no good purpose,
and besides I only wished to write you good news——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What now, Drusa? What is it? What have you
been keeping from me, it is very wrong for you to keep any
secret from me, let me tell you,” anxiously exclaimed Alexander,
looking searchingly in her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, it was no secret at all. It was only a little
rudeness I was made to bear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rudeness! From whom?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>“From people who were scarcely responsible for their
actions, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who were they? What rudeness did they offer
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You remember those officers that came into our box at
the opera?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes—vagabonds! vulgar wretches! what about
them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They saw me in at a Ladies’ Tea Room in the city, one
day when I went shopping.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In a Ladies’ Tea Room! Drusilla, I am shocked that
you should have gone into such a place unattended. I am
annoyed beyond measure that you should have done so!
No modest young woman, not to say lady, ever goes alone
to such a place!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick dear, it was the very room you used to take me
to, whenever you took me to the city in the first days of
our marriage. And I saw ladies there and young ladies
and little girls, and even babies and nurses—and one always
feels right and safe where there are babies, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I don’t know it. And besides the ladies and
children you speak of were family parties; you went <i>alone;</i>
no wonder you were insulted. Which of the villains
insulted you—or did both?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neither did, Alick dear. Please don’t be angry. One
of the officers came up and spoke to me, calling me ‘Miss’
and claiming my acquaintance. But as you had not introduced
him to me I would not know him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And—then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I left the Tea Room and got into the carriage and drove
home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And was that all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; the two officers and the two women that were with
them jumped into a hack and followed me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ten thousand demons!—<i>Home?</i>” burst forth Mr.
Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>“Ah Alick dear, no; don’t be so violent. There was no
harm done. I wouldn’t even have mentioned the matter,
only you asked me a question that I was bound to answer
truthfully,” pleaded the gentle creature.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How far did they follow you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only to the gate of the road leading through the woods
to our house—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To our—” Here Alexander burst into an explosion of
oaths and expletives that caused his wife to shudder with
horror.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, Alick, don’t, dear! don’t! It is a sin! Oh,
Alick, hush! You frighten me so!” she pleaded almost
breathlessly, clinging to his arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I catch one of those villains I will blow his brains
out. If I don’t, may the—” And here Alexander sealed
his oath by invoking a terrible imprecation on his own soul
if he failed to keep it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my love, my dear, don’t, don’t. Heaven will never
forgive you!” wept Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stop whimpering, you provoking little fool, and tell me.
Did they attempt to follow you through the gate?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Alick, but they couldn’t do it, because Leo closed
it and locked it—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! let me only lay my eyes on them—that is all! If
they get off with life may I be——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Hsh-sh!</i> Oh, Alick, dear, this is awful!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold your tongue, and take your hand from my lips!
And now, if you can speak to some purpose, do so! How
long was this ago that they dared to pursue you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“About nine days since, Alick. But they scarcely knew
what they were about. Indeed they did not, Alick love!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have they troubled you since?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not once. I have neither seen nor heard of them
since, nor has any one else annoyed me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is well so far. But now I am convinced that one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>of those villains was identical with the spy who frightened
you by looking through the window. I wish I had not to
hurry back to Richmond to-night. If I could only remain
in the city one day, I might settle accounts with these gentlemen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, then for the first time I am—what I never
thought I should be—glad that you are going away so soon!
Ah, my own dear husband, absence is bitter, but not so bitter
as sin and its consequences! Oh, my dear, dear Alick,
I shall pray day and night that Heaven may keep you from
blood guiltiness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time they had reached the house, which they
soon entered.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Alick did not get over his fit of fury until some
hours later, when dinner was served and he had eaten a
hearty meal, and drank several glasses of fine wine, and
was luxuriating in the sedative vapors of a real Havana.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fragrant fumes of the good cigar did not drive Drusilla
away. She sat near him with a little piece of crochet
work in her fingers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want you to promise me one thing, Drusa,” said
Alick, taking the weed from his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will promise you anything in the world,” she
answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dare say! But would you perform it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, indeed, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you could.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, of course that is understood! Providence permitting,
I will do whatever you wish.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, the promises I wish you to make me will not be
very hard to keep. In the first place, I want you to give
me your word that you will not go into Washington unless
in case of necessity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have my word for that, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when obliged to go, that you will show yourself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>as little as possible; that you will never recognize or
speak with any acquaintance, old or new, whom you may
happen to meet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I give you my word for these also, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that you will never under any circumstances
whatever, or to any person whoever, give your name or
address, or mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take my word for that, too. I promise—solemnly
promise to remember and obey all your directions, Alick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is right,” he said. And he resumed his cigar,
and smoked in comfort for some minutes, and then threw
away the stump, and got up, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must see about going.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick! So soon, dear!” she exclaimed, in dismay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So soon? Why, it is seven o’clock now, and the boat
leaves at nine. I have but two hours to get it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leo can drive you there easily in one hour, Alick.
The horses are quite fresh, and will go like the wind. And
besides, I want you to take tea with me before you leave,”
she said, touching the bell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I can take a cup of tea while Leo is putting the
horses to the carriage, I suppose,” he admitted, resuming
his seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina came in to answer the bell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla told her to set the table for tea. And Mr.
Lyon directed her to tell Leo to put the horses to the carriage
and bring it around to the door, and to get himself
ready to drive to town.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina went out to obey both her orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will not be long absent this time, will you,
Alick?” inquired Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know, Drusa; but not a day longer than is
necessary,” he evasively replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—can’t you give me some little idea, Alick, just to
comfort me while you are away? Will you be gone a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>week, ten days, a fortnight—or how long do you think,
dear Alick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Drusa, my child, you must not seek to bind me
by any promise to return at any fixed time. See how it
has inconvenienced me on this occasion, and without giving
you much gratification either. Here, because I felt bound
by the promise I had given you, I was compelled to drop
my business at a most important crisis, and hurry on here
just to see you for a few hours, and then hurry back. If
you had not bound me by that promise, I <i>might</i> possibly,
by staying a few days longer in Richmond, and putting my
business in a better state of progress, have been enabled to
come and stay longer with you. But as it is, I must be off
at once. So you see the evil of binding a man to any
fixed time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Alick. I don’t wish to bind you to anything,
dear. I will only trust that you will come back to me as
soon as you can,” she meekly replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As soon as it shall be proper to do so, I will come
back,” he answered evasively.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina came in and set the table, and brought in the tea
service and arranged it.</p>

<p class='c011'>They—the faithful wife and faithless husband sat down
together for the last time at that table.</p>

<p class='c011'>She filled his cup and handed it to him, and urged upon
him the delicate dainties that she had prepared for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Alick, whose appetite seldom suffered under any
circumstances, enjoyed the luxuries of the tea-table as much
as if he had not dined sumptuously a few hours previous.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as soon as he heard the carriage approaching the
door, he got up, went into the hall, followed by Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here he put on his overcoat and gloves, snatched his wife
to his bosom for one hasty embrace and adieu; then took
his hat, ran out of the house, jumped into the carriage, and
ordered the coachman to drive fast towards town.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>The carriage started.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this time Alexander was gone for good.</p>

<p class='c006'>Alexander had come and gone like a dream. And, in
truth, his flying visit had given his young wife little
comfort. He had spent more than half the few hours he
had passed at home in grumbling.</p>

<p class='c011'>As usual, she could not find it in her heart to blame him.
To keep up her spirits, she set about putting in order her
little house that had been somewhat disarranged by his
sudden arrival and departure. In the words of another
wronged woman, she was “resigned, but not happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her days passed quietly, if not cheerfully. She occupied
herself with her small household affairs; with making up
the pretty liliputian wardrobe upon which she was engaged;
with taking care of her birds; and with gardening,
walking and riding during the day.</p>

<p class='c011'>She spent her evenings in reading and writing, or singing
and playing.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was comforted with three sweet hopes: the first was
for his letters, the second his return, and the third the arrival
of the little stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>She arose with the earliest dawn of day, and she retired
early in the evening, and so her health continued to
improve.</p>

<p class='c011'>But day succeeded day, until a week had passed away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>and still she received no letter from her absent husband.
Then she grew weary and sad.</p>

<p class='c011'>The truth is that Alexander, with a false mercy in keeping
with his false course at this time, was putting into
practice his sapient plan of “breaking with her gradually,”
which was just distilling to her, drop by drop, the bitterness
of “despised love;” inflicting on her the intolerable
torture of a slow heart-breaking.</p>

<p class='c011'>After ten days had gone by she received a note from
him; it was short, cool and dry. He said that he had
reached Richmond in safety, but had been too busy to write
before; that he was well and hoped she was; and that he
remained her affectionate—“A.” There were not half a
dozen lines in the whole letter, and Drusilla thought the
writing did not look like Alexander’s hand. But she read
it over and over again, and her tears dropped slowly down
upon it as she murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Too busy to write’ to me—‘too busy to write.’ Oh,
Alick, dear, what sort of business would it be that could
keep me from writing to you for ten whole days? But,
then, I am a woman and you are a man, and that makes all
the difference, I suppose. But, oh, my heart is so weak—so
weak, my Heavenly Father!” she cried, suddenly, in
her sorrow, appealing to the All Compassionate.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then again she betook herself to work as an antidote
to despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>After this a heart-sickening month of silence passed
away, in which she heard no word from him. And then
she got a second note, dated from some distant village in
New England, from which he wrote to tell her that he had
been travelling for the last four weeks, and he was travelling
still upon that business growing out of his father’s will;
that it would be useless for her to write to him, as he was
continually moving rapidly from place to place, and could
not wait to receive her letters. His health continued good,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>and he hoped that hers did. And he was ever her friend—“A.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This letter filled less than half a page, and the writing
was even less like Alexander’s than that of the other one
had been. And Drusilla wept bitterly over it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I were not his wife, I should think he was deserting
me by degrees,” she sobbed, hitting at last the very truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>In addition to all her other causes of distress, she had the
bitterness of knowing that he had not waited to get one of
the affectionate daily letters she had directed to him at
Richmond; that they were all wasted, like her love, because
he had not even taken the trouble to tell her that he was
going to travel.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now one word about Alexander’s duplicity, which he
called discretion. (If people could be got to call crimes by
their right names, perhaps they would not commit them.)
When Alexander was at home, having access to all Drusilla’s
boxes, he secretly got possession of all the letters he
had ever written to her and he destroyed them. His first
subsequent letter was written from Richmond, to which he
had come with his uncle and cousin for a sojourn of a few
days previous to setting out with them on a tour of pleasure.
His second one was from a hamlet in the Green Mountains,
where he was staying with the General and Miss Anna, in
these first warm days of July. Both letters were written
in a disguised hand, and signed only with his initial, lest
they should ever be brought up against him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some suspicion of his bad faith was forcing its way
even into the confiding bosom of his wife. But the heart-wasting
weariness of the next few weeks, who can tell?
To keep her heart from breaking, she kept steadily at work.
Ah, work! How great is the love of our Heavenly Father
in commuting the very curse laid upon man at his fall into
blessings; in infusing into the very punishment of his sins
consolation for his suffering. For surely, in addition to its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>creative and productive force, work has consoling power,
since, next after religion, it is to the desolate and wearyhearted
the greatest comfort on earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla found it so; for, if occupation did not give
her happiness, it certainty kept her from despair. The
months rolled slowly on. One of the most distressing
elements in her misery was the fact she could not even
write to her husband, not knowing where to direct her letters;
and this was farther embittered by the knowledge
that he himself had cut off all such communication between
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still she continued to send Leo daily to the post-office in
the hope of getting a letter from him; but week after
week wore away without bringing news of Alexander.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the hope of hearing of him, if she could not hear
from him, she wrote and ordered the principal daily papers
from all the great cities in the north. And huge
was the bundle that Leo brought every day from the
news agent in Washington.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when she was disappointed in getting a letter, as
she was always sure to be, she would, with a morbid
eagerness, carefully con over the names in the list of
arrivals at the various hotels in all the cities, in the faint
hope of seeing his name in some one of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this was worse than “hunting for a needle in a
haystack,” for it was hunting for what was lost somewhere
else.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes in fear and trembling she would even look
over the deaths and the casualties, in the dread of seeing
his name among the victims. But she never saw it anywhere.
We could have told her, “Naught is never in
danger.” If she did not see the name of her truant husband,
she saw something else that startled her, and it was
this:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span><span class='sc'>Next of Kin.</span>—If the heirs of the late Reverend Malcomb
Sterling should see this advertisement they will please to communicate
immediately with the undersigned, from whom they will
hear something to their advantage.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'><span class='sc'>Kent &#38; Heneage</span>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Solicitors, 33 Bar street, Baltimore.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla stared at this notice in astonishment. And
then she read it over again two or three times. <i>She</i>
was the only living representative of the late Malcomb
Sterling. Her father’s last pastoral charge had been in
Baltimore. This advertisement appeared in a Baltimore
paper, and the firm to be communicated with were Baltimore
lawyers. Clearly the notice originated with some one
who had taken pains to trace her poor father’s last abiding
place, in order to advertise there for his heirs. It must,
therefore, be of considerable importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her first impulse was to cut out the piece and enclose it
in a letter to her husband, that he might deal with it as he
should deem proper. But then she instantly recollected
that she was ignorant of Mr. Lyon’s address.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a little reflection she concluded that it was her own
duty to communicate with the advertising parties.</p>

<p class='c011'>So she sat down and wrote to the firm of Kent &#38;
Heneage, and told them that she was the only child of the
late Reverend Malcomb Sterling, by his wife Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sent off this letter; and soon forgot all about the
matter in her all-engrossing anxiety to hear from her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>As before, she every day sent Leo to the post office, with
orders if he should find a letter by the first mail to hasten
home with it immediately; if not, to wait for the second
mail.</p>

<p class='c011'>On a fresh and brilliant morning of the third day after
she had written to the lawyers, Drusilla was at work in her
flower-garden, when she saw Leo galloping toward the
house, and holding out at arm’s length a letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The face of the boy, who had seen and understood his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>mistress’s daily disappointment, was beaming with delight,
as he drew rein before her, sprang from his saddle, and
handed her the letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>She seized it eagerly, believing it to be from her husband,
and exclaimed in her joy:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you, Leo! At last—at last! Oh, I’m so
glad!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Deed, so am I, ma’am—glad as if I’d had a fortin left
me,” answered the boy, showing in every tone and look as
much sympathy as he could combine with very much
respect, “which it is from master, ma’am, and I hope he is
well?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the little lady’s face had fallen. The letter was not
from her beloved husband, announcing his speedy arrival.
It was only from the firm of Kent &#38; Heneage, and it <i>only</i>
informed her of her inheritance of a vast estate, by the
decease of a bachelor great-uncle, who was a merchant of
San Francisco with a corresponding house in Baltimore,
and who had recently died intestate in the first mentioned
city.</p>

<p class='c011'>This news would have made some women very happy.
But not Drusilla. The reaction with her was great. Tears
of disappointment swelled her eyelids, and dropped upon the
open page.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo, who was watching her in reverential interest, seeing
her tears, now spoke:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope nothing is amiss with master, ma’am!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No—I don’t know. Oh, Leo! it is not from your master;
it is nothing but a mere business letter from a lawyer!”
said the little lady, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that all, ma’am?” responded the boy in a disappointed
tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All, Leo,” his mistress answered, as she turned sadly
towards the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not care a farthing for the death or the inheritance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of the old bachelor uncle, of whom she had not heard
mention made more than three times in her life, and who,
while he was rolling in wealth, had left her dying father,
her mother and herself to suffer the bitterest pains of poverty.</p>

<p class='c011'>She neglected to answer the lawyer’s letter, and gave
herself up to grief and anxiety about her careless but still
beloved husband, until a week had passed away, when she
received another, and a very urgent letter from Messrs.
Kent &#38; Heneage, asking to hear from her by return mail.</p>

<p class='c011'>This one she immediately answered. And this was the
beginning of a long epistolary correspondence between Drusilla
and Kent &#38; Heneage of Baltimore, and Speight &#38;
Wright of San Francisco. In the course of this correspondence
the heiress learned that both those legal firms
had been the solicitors of her uncle, the millionaire, and
that the first had managed his business in Baltimore, and
the last in San Francisco; that the whole estate, comprising
the property in both cities, was estimated at three
millions of dollars, and consisted in warehouses, shipping
goods, and bank stock. But she was also advised that she
would be required to prove her identity, and establish every
link in the chain of evidence that connected her with her
uncle before she could take possession of the property.
And Messrs. Kent &#38; Heneage tendered her the help of all
their legal skill, learning and experience, in establishing her
claims.</p>

<p class='c011'>Young as she was, Drusilla saw at once that there would
be no difficulty in proving herself the lawful heiress of the
deceased Crœsus. So she wrote to the lawyers that the
genealogical line to be traced was very plain, short and
straight; that every point in its progress could be proved
by church registers, court records, private letters, and personal
friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the firm wrote to her requesting a personal interview,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>and offering either to receive her at their office in
Baltimore, or to visit her at her own home in Washington.</p>

<p class='c011'>And here arose Drusilla’s first difficulty. She had dated
her letters, not from Cedarwood, but simply from Washington
City, and though she had signed them Drusilla
Sterling Lyon, she had not said one word about her state
as a married woman, thus unconsciously leaving it to be
assumed that she was a widow, acting upon her own responsibility.
She could not write of her marriage, because
it had been her husband’s will that it should be kept secret
from all but the faithful servants who were in their confidence.
And for this cause, also, she could neither visit the
lawyers at their office, nor receive them at her house. She
was puzzled how to act.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick, Alick, dear,” she sighed, as she read over
again the lawyer’s letter; “Oh, Alick, darling, how your
long absence and this forced secrecy does constantly compromise
me. I find myself in a cruelly false position.
What shall I do now? Wait till I see you before I take
another step in this matter? That is what I must do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she sat down and wrote to Messrs. Kent &#38;
Heneage, telling them that it was not just at present convenient
for her to leave home, or to receive visitors, but
that she hoped it might be so in a few weeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And this looks very like a subterfuge,” she said to herself
as she revised her own lines. “And what will they
think of me for putting them off in this foolish way?
Think me an impostor as likely as not. And who can
wonder if they do? Oh, Alick! Alick!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She sent her letter off, and for a week or ten days, she
heard no more of her legal friends. This correspondence,
embarrassing as it was to her, and difficult as it was for her
to manage, upon account of her false position as a secretly
wedded wife, had nevertheless done her good, in distracting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>her thoughts from the intense grief and anxiety she
had suffered from the long absence and total silence of
her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, the summer wore wearily away. On the first
of September, she received another letter from her new legal
acquaintances, praying her no longer to neglect so important
a manner as the establishment of her claims to the
heirship of the great Sterling property.</p>

<p class='c011'>Amid painful feelings of shame that she might not speak
out plainly, that she must be secretive and seem deceitful,
she penned a reply, asking the lawyer’s pardon for having
appeared neglectful; beseeching them yet to have a little
patience with her; telling them that circumstances which
she could not at present command, precluded her from proceeding
farther in this matter; but expressing an earnest
hope that in a short time she might be able to do so. She
begged to assure them that as she was truly the lawful
heiress of her deceased uncle, Charles Sterling, being the
only surviving descendant of his only brother, and he having
left no other kindred, so her claim to the estate could
not fail to be established; and that when it should be, she
begged them to believe, that they should find that their
time and labor, and kind interest in her affairs, had not
been thrown away.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a simple, earnest truthfulness and good feeling
in this other mystifying letter, that must have carried
conviction of the writer’s good faith even to the unbelieving
legal mind. For within three days, Drusilla received an
answer from the firm, saying that they regretted the delay
upon her own account, but would wait her pleasure and
convenience.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so this correspondence ceased for the time being.</p>

<p class='c011'>September passed slowly away, without bringing any
letter from Mr. Lyon. And oh, in what weariness, heaviness,
sorrow and soreness of heart, it passed with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>young neglected wife, who can describe, or even imagine?
She was almost dying of hope deferred. A fatal suspicion
of her husband’s falsehood was slowly, but surely, eating
its way into her heart and life. And still the bitterest element
in her sorrow was the fact that she could make no
appeal to any remaining tenderness he might have for her,
not even knowing where to write to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>October came, and then,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When hope was coldest, and despair most deep,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>a letter arrived from Alexander. She was that evening
sitting and shivering, not from cold, but from nervousness,
over a bright little fire in her dressing-room, when Pina
ran in, without the ceremony of rapping, and exclaimed,
breathlessly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s Leo, ma’am, which he’s just brung a letter from
the post-office, as he says must be from master, because
it’s got Richmond printed onto it, and he can read
print, though not writing. And he says how he’ll bring
the letter in and put it into your hands himself, and
here he is—”</p>

<p class='c011'>Before Pina had finished half her speech, Drusilla had
jumped up and run to meet Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he entered the room, with his face beaming with
pleasure, she snatched the letter from his grasp, tore it
open and devoured its contents.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! poor child! little comfort that long-looked for
letter brought her. It was shorter, drier and colder than
any that had gone before it. Alexander vouchsafed not one
word of excuse for his long silence. He announced his
arrival at Richmond; and told her that he could not with
propriety pay her a visit that autumn, for reasons that he
would explain to her in a subsequent letter; he hoped that
she was in as good health and spirits as he begged to assure
her that he himself was; and he subscribed himself her
friend and well-wisher, “A.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Drusilla dropped the letter, and burst into a passion of
sobs and tears, that much alarmed her loving servants.</p>

<p class='c011'>They thought no less than that their master had met
with a fatal accident, or was smitten with a deathly disorder,
if he was not already dead and buried.</p>

<p class='c011'>They tried to help and comfort her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo went and brought her a glass of ice-water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina poured some Florida water upon a handkerchief and
offered her, saying caressingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mist’ess, dear, don’t take on so. It’s the Lord’s
will, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is <span class='fss'>NOT</span>, Pina! The sin of man is <span class='fss'>NOT</span> the will of
God!” passionately broke forth the long-suffering soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mist’ess, dear, ’scuse me. I didn’t know ’twas sin.
I thought ’twas only sickness, or something.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—hush!—I spoke hastily—I spoke without thinking.
There, Pina, that will do. Thank you, child. Go, leave
me now; I am better by myself; <i>do</i> go. Leo, take her
away,” with difficulty gasped Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when she had got her servants out of the room and
bolted the door, she threw herself into her chair and gave
free vent to the suppressed sobs and tears that had been
nearly choking her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what a letter to write me! After such a long and
cruel silence too! Cannot pay me a visit this autumn!
‘<i>Pay me a visit!</i>’ What does he mean by that? This
is his home and I am his wife. And he signs himself
my friend and well-wisher. ‘<i>Friend and well-wisher!</i>’
And no more than that? Why he is my husband! Oh,
<i>what</i> does he mean by this cruel letter?” she cried,
with streaming eyes and heaving breast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she drew from her bosom the small black silk bag,
took from it the piece of paper of which mention has already
made, read it through her tear-dimmed eyes, then kissed
and replaced it, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>“If it was not for this precious little document, I should
think he meant to abandon me. I should fear that I was
not his wife. I should fear I had been fooled by a false
marriage. But this bit of paper proves that I am truly his
lawful wife—though he treats me more like a—Ah,
Heaven forgive him! I am very glad I found this little
document. It reassures me when I doubt. And this great
grief so clouds my mind that I suppose I can’t help doubting,
even when such doubt is mere madness. But I have
the paper, and ‘seeing is believing,’” she sighed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! how little the poor young creature knew that the
document upon which she founded her faith in the indissoluble
legality of her marriage was the very same upon
which Alexander Lyon, her husband, based his belief in
his freedom from matrimonial bonds.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this is a mystery.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as she had recovered some degree of composure,
she availed herself of her knowledge of his address to write
to him the first letter she had been able to send him in
some months. In this letter so entirely was she taken up
by her love and her sorrow, that she utterly forgot to mention
the enormous fortune that had been left her. She
wrote him a long, earnest, impassioned appeal, praying him
by the love he once bore her, and by the love that she must
ever bear him, since it was the life of her life, to come to
her, if only for a little while; she said, pathetically, that
she would never ask it again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, these words are cold and lifeless,” she wrote. “But
if you were here, my soul would find some means of reaching
yours. My lips and my eyes and my hands would show
you that they only live when they meet yours. Oh, come
home! I die, Alick! I die! Come and save me! Come,
if only for a little while. Oh, my beloved, my whole heart
and soul and life goes out in this cry—<i>Come home!</i>”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As before, day after day passed slowly and sadly over the
head of the young forsaken wife. The golden month of
October was declining towards its close, and still she received
no letter from her husband in answer to her last impassioned
appeal.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wrote again and again; but with no better success.
How he must have steeled his breast against her to resist
the pleading of her letters, where every word seemed a tear
of blood wrung from her crushed and bleeding heart. But
most likely he did not even trust himself to read them.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this agony of suspense, she must have either maddened
or died, but for the “little angel” she expected; for
it is scarcely possible for the mother of an unborn babe,
even under the greatest trials and heaviest sorrows, either
to lose her reason, or break her heart. In making ready for
the little one, and in looking for its coming, she found an
antidote against despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>But her moods, of course, varied with the state of her
nerves. There were times in which she hoped, when her
hour should come, that both she and her babe might be permitted
to die, and go to their eternal rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where I shall never trouble him more; or, perhaps
regret him, either, though this is doubtful. Oh, Alick!
Alick!” she would exclaim, with a burst of tears and sobs.</p>

<p class='c011'>But these miserable spells of despondency she always
repented as sins. And she, afterwards, prayed that her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>babe might live, and that she might be forgiven, and spared
and strengthened to raise it.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was so young and inexperienced that she did not
know when to count upon the advent of the little stranger;
but she felt sure that the time could not be far off.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in the last days of October, that she received
another letter from her recreant husband. She was standing
at the window of her bed-chamber, watching for the
arrival of Leo from the post-office, as she had watched for
so many days, when she saw the boy riding towards the
house.</p>

<p class='c011'>She tapped on the glass panes to attract his attention;
and he heard her, and he pulled a letter from his pocket,
and held it up to view as he struck the spurs to his horse’s
flanks and dashed rapidly up to the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>She rushed down to meet him, and snatched the letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“From Richmond, madam,” he said; “which I hope
master is well, and is coming home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, from Richmond,” she said, tearing the envelope
open, and beginning to run her eyes over it, as she went
back to her room and sank into her resting chair. For the
poor young wife and expectant mother could not now rush
about and excite herself with impunity.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sank, faint, dizzy and breathless, into her chair, and
tried to read her letter; but the words ran together, and
the lines reeled before her eyes; and some minutes passed
before she was sufficiently recovered and calmed to do so.
And as she gathered the meaning of this most cruel of all
his heartless letters, her pale face grew paler still, her
breath came in short gasps, and her frame shook as with
an ague fit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before she had quite finished reading it, she let it drop
from her hands, threw up her arms, and, with a piercing
shriek, fell forward to the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>And well she might.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>This murderous letter Alexander had sent to his wronged
wife as a <i><span lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In it he told her that humanity had induced him to prepare
her, by a long abstinence from her society, for the
painful communication he was about to make. He dared
to hope that by this time she must have seen that there
was something wrong in their union, and some good cause
other than he had before stated for his keeping away from
her. He said that now he believed she was ready to learn,
without a great shock, which he had studied to spare her,
the true cause of his parting from her. He then went on
to tell her that early in the month of March he had discovered,
to his own great astonishment, that their union was
utterly null, void, and illegal; that he could not find it in
his heart at that time to shock her with the fatal news; but
he made up his mind to prepare her for it by degrees, and
finally to break it to her very slowly. He begged to
remind her that since the day upon which he had made
the discovery of the unlawfulness of their connection he
had never wronged her by intruding into her private apartments,
or treating her otherwise than with the reserve due
to a lady and the affection owed to a sister. He repeated
that he had tried to spare her pain in the breaking of this
tie, the severance of which was as distressing to him as it
could possibly be to her. He assured her that, though
duty forbade him ever to see her face again, he should provide
for her future welfare, by securing to her the little
estate upon which she lived. He concluded by telling her,
that as propriety required all possible intercourse, even by
writing, to cease between them, and as he himself was
about to leave town for the country, it would be useless for
her to reply to his letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is to be noted that in this cruel communication he
took care to say no more than was absolutely necessary to
quell and quiet her claims on him. He did not even call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>her by name, but addressed her as “my poor little friend.”
He did not acknowledge the receipt of any of her letters.
And, worse than all, he failed to specify the cause of the
alleged illegality of their marriage—whether it had
chanced in any informality of the ceremony, which might
be remedied by a second and more careful solemnization of
the rites; or whether it existed in the shape of some insurmountable
impediment that must forbid their union.
Nor did he venture to allude to his former betrothal and
his approaching wedding with his cousin Anna. Indeed,
all proper names of persons and places seemed studiously
left out. The writing also, was in a disguised hand, and
without date or signature.</p>

<p class='c011'>Altogether it was a careful work of a cautious man, who
would have been an astute villain and a successful schemer
if he had not, in the blindness of his selfishness, overreached
even himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>It bore no internal signs of the writer or of the person
to whom it was written. It might have been sent by
another man to another woman. It could never be successfully
produced in evidence against any one in any court.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if he took this precaution with the idea that his
deeply wronged wife could ever drag her domestic sorrows
before a public tribunal, and expose his private letters for
her own vindication, he had studied her character to very
little purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>The blow he had dealt had well nigh proved her death
stroke. It struck her to the floor. Her cry and her fall
aroused her servants, who came running to her room in
haste. They found her stretched in a swoon on the carpet,
with the open letter beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Master’s dead now, for sure!” exclaimed Leo, in consternation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And no harm done if he is!” cried Pina, who had,
with her woman’s wit, long ago detected the bad faith.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>“But it’s killed mist’ess!” groaned the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It hain’t! it’s only overcome her like! Help me to get
her up, and don’t stand there blubbering!” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between them they tenderly lifted their mistress and
laid her on her bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Leo, you go out and stop in the passage, so as to
be in calling distance if I want anything. And leave me
alone with my madam. I’ve seen her in these here fainty
fits before, and I know what to do with her. Come, now!”
impatiently exclaimed Pina, seeing that her brother still
lingered, “be off with you, will you? It ain’t no ways
proper for you to be looking on while I’m unloosening of
her clothes!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This hint drove the boy in haste from the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina proceeded to undress her mistress, turning her
about very gently on the bed, until she had freed all her
fastenings so as to give her lungs the fullest play. Then
she applied the usual potent stimulants, and after much
patient effort, she had the pleasure of seeing the little lady
open her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Drusilla recovered her senses only to fall into the
most violent paroxysms of grief and despair. Convulsive
sobs shook her whole frame; bitter groans burst from her
lips; tears gushed in torrents from her eyes. As her
passion of grief arose, she wrung her hands, and writhed,
and threw herself from side to side, moaning piteously.
Then in her frenzy of despair, she sprang up and began
walking about the room, striking her hands together, and
uttering piercing cries.</p>

<p class='c011'>In truth, hers was not a mute grief. Your “silent
sorrow” belongs to a little later period of life, when years
have taught the sufferer such resignation that she will “die
and make no sign.” But on this stricken young wife a
blow had fallen, heavy enough to crush the strongest
woman, while she was yet little more than a child. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>she felt it with all a child’s intense sensibility, and she
grieved with a child’s excessive vehemence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Vainly her maid tried to restrain her or to comfort her,
Pina followed her mistress up and down the room, weeping
for company, and pleading with her—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mist’ess darling, don’t take on so dreadful! Don’t
mist’ess, that’s a dear! Oh, what has happened? Tell
your true servant, who never left you but only once, and
never will do so wicked an act again, never, if there’s
twenty robbers in the house. Oh, mist’ess, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, girl, girl, he has left me, he has left me forever,”
cried the poor young wife, with another gush of tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it showed how utterly abject and self-abandoned she
was in her profound and terrible sorrow, when she could
forget her dignity, and make complaint in the presence of
her youthful servant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has left me, Pina! Oh, he has left me forever!”
she repeated, wringing her hands and sobbing violently.
“He has gone, he has gone for good!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Blest if I don’t think it <i>is</i> for good! and a good riddance
of uncommon bad rubbish!” grumbled the girl in a
low voice; but she did not dare to let her words be heard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what shall I do? Oh, what shall I do?” cried
the wretched wife, walking wildly about the room and
wringing her hands. “He has left me forever! forever and
ever!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you believe one word of that, ma’am, now, don’t,
that’s a dear lady! Lors, he wouldn’t have the heart! he
couldn’t stay away from you forever, no, not if he was to
try to ever so hard,” said Pina, soothingly, as she followed
her mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But he says so himself! he says so!” exclaimed Drusilla,
with a passionate burst of weeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, he says so, and maybe he thinks so, but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>can’t do it. It’s only because some wicked woman has got
the whip hand of him now. But lor bless you, <i>that</i> can’t
last. All men is fools, ma’am. I know that much, if I
don’t know any more. But lor! the foolishest of ’em knows
gold from brass, and is sure to come back to the old love
and the true love, for their <i>own</i> interests. Goodness knows
they never does anything for ours! He’ll come back,
ma’am! Bad pennies always does.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh,” moaned Drusilla, “how low I have fallen! how
low, to say what I have said, and to hear what I have
heard! Pina, my girl, hush. You must not speak of
your master in this manner, especially in my presence. It
is untrue of him and disrespectful to us both,” she added,
as calmly as she could force herself to speak, as she dropped
into her resting chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was but a short lull in the storm of her grief; for
presently, the keen sense of her husband’s desertion and
her own desolation, pierced her heart, and she fell into a
fresh paroxysm of sobs and tears, and leaving her chair,
walked distractedly about the room, raving and wringing
her hands as before.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina went to her and threw her arms around her, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mist’ess, mist’ess, don’t do so! You’ll kill yourself
and kill your child!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better I were dead! better my child should never be
born!” cried the frantic woman, abandoning herself to the
wildest excesses of despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mist’ess, don’t say so! and don’t rave so! If you
have no pity for yourself, have some for the poor little blind
and breathless baby that depends on you for its life; and
don’t kill it before it has even a soul to be saved!” pleaded
Pina, touching the most sensitive chord in the mother’s
heart and in the Christian conscience.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give me something! Give me something to benumb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>this keen pang, then. Give me opium! Give me anything
that will dull my heart and brain without doing
harm,” she demanded, sitting down in her chair, and making
a great effort to control the violence of her emotions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina mixed a composing draught of tincture of valerian
and water and brought it to her mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla drank it, and its effect upon her sensitive
system was instantaneous and powerful. Though her eyes
still streamed with tears, the convulsive heavings of her
bosom subsided, and she became comparatively calm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, mist’ess, darlin’, you just let me help you to bed
and you lay still and keep quiet. And I will darken the
room and sit by you. And may be you will go to sleep and
then you will be better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla, docile as a child now, suffered her maid to
put her to bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the girl was smoothing the white counterpane and
making everything tidy about the dainty couch, Drusilla
suddenly put her hand to her throat and with a frightened
look cried out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where—where is—?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you mean the little black silk bag, ma’am, that was
tied around you neck?” inquired Pina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes! yes! where is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I took it off when I undressed you, while you were in
your fainty fit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where did you put it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In your upper bureau drawer, ma’am, where it is quite
safe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Pina, bring it back to me directly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl obeyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it a relic, ma’am?” inquired Pina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered her mistress. And so it was, though
not of the sort Pina was thinking of.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I beg pardon—I didn’t know, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>“And now, Pina, no matter how ill I may become, you
must never let this be removed from my bosom again. It
is more precious to me than anything I have in the world
except my Bible and my wedding-ring,” said Drusilla, as
she fastened the treasure around her neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, ma’am! Then I will be very careful not to
have it removed. Now try to compose yourself, ma’am,”
said Pina, as she proceeded to close the shutters and draw
the curtains to darken the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla complied with this good advice, and folding her
hands as if in prayer, lay very quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina went to the chamber door and spoke to Leo, who
had remained on duty in the passage for some hours. She
told him that their mistress was now better, and that he
might go down stairs and look after his own affairs, and
that she would call him if his services should be needed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo, glad to hear of the little lady’s improvement, glad
also to be relieved from duty, hurried down into the kitchen
to look for something to eat, of which he stood greatly in
need, not having broken his fast since he went to the post-office
in the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina took her place by her mistress’s bed, and patiently
watched there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Night deepened; but the girl lighted no lamp, finding
the subdued glow of the low wood-fire on the hearth sufficient
to see by.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla lay so motionless that Pina thought she slept.
But by bending down and looking attentively at the supposed
sleeper, the watcher saw that her lips were moving as
in silent prayer. And soon deep sighs arose from the sufferer’s
bosom, and large tears rolled down her face. She
was awake and weeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina silently arose and mixed another dose of the beneficial
composing draught, and brought it to the bedside.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla drank it. And soon after she fell asleep. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>the youthful watcher, with her heavy head dropped upon
the side of the bed, also slept well.</p>

<p class='c006'>At daylight Pina awoke. Finding her mistress still
sleeping heavily under the influence of the sedative, she
arose and replenished the fire and then went down stairs
and got her own breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>After which she prepared some very strong coffee and
some delicate milk toast, and took it up to the lady’s
chamber and set it upon the hearth to be kept warm until
her mistress should awake.</p>

<p class='c011'>But with the hapless young wife the awakening was but
the return to anguish.</p>

<p class='c011'>With great difficulty Pina prevailed on her to take a
little food. There was but one argument the girl could
successfully use with the expectant mother—her child. To
keep up her strength for its sake, Drusilla tried to eat and
drink, though even the coffee and the soft toast seemed to
choke her in her effort to swallow them.</p>

<p class='c011'>After this little repast she fell back upon her pillow, too
spirit-broken to wish to leave her bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina opened the front windows to let in the cheerful
light of the golden autumn morning; and then she took
the breakfast tray down into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo was sitting there, polishing his cutlery.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>“How’s mist’ess?” inquired the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s hard to say. I know I’d rather see her in a rale
bad spell of illness, like the typus fever, or something, than
this way. Her heart’s broke; that’s how she is. And I
tell you what, Leo, long’s master’s done broke faith with
mist’ess I don’t see how we got any call to keep faith long
o’ him,” grumbled the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Broke faith with her?” echoed the boy, pausing in his
work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that letter he writ said he wasn’t coming back no
more. And that’s what’s killed her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now look here, Leo—if <i>he’s</i> not coming back to
take care of her, somebody must, that is certain. I don’t
know enough, although I did help mammy to bring up all
my little brothers and sisters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what do you want <i>me</i> to do? I’ll do anything in
the world for mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I tell you. Leo, I want you to go down to Alexdry
and fetch mammy to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But good gracious me alive, that is as much as my ears
are worth! Didn’t master order us not to have any followers,
not even our own kin folks?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I told you before, if master don’t keep faith long o’
mist’ess, we ain’t got no call to keep faith long o’ him,
’specially when it’s to rist her life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, if that’s the case, I’ll go at once,” answered the
boy. For it was only necessary to convince him that his
mistress’s safety depended on “mammy’s” arrival to make
him eager to go and fetch her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet just as he was about to leave the kitchen he turned
and inquired;</p>

<p class='c011'>“But isn’t better to ask mist’ess first?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>No</i>; she would be sure to object, though it’s for her
own safety. You go and fetch mammy. And then I’ll let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>on to mist’ess how she come on a wisit to me, promiscuous
like, and I’ll ’vise mist’ess to see mammy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right; but if you get me into a scrape for nothing,
you know, Pina, it will be your own fault.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just so; and I’ll be willing to bear all the blame.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo went upon his errand, and Pina hurried up to her
mistress’s chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla had thrown herself out of bed, and was walking
distractedly up and down the room, with her dark hair falling
down over her white night-dress, her face pale, her eyes
wild, and her fingers wreathed and wrung together in an
agony of grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>Vain were all Pina’s efforts to soothe her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I do but feel my trouble more and more! more
and more as the hours go by! If I only could see him!
If I could see him once and speak to him, he would hear
me! he could not let me die before his sight,” she sobbed
forth, with her eyes streaming with tears, whose fountains
seemed exhaustless.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s like p’isoning of her to save her life; but it’s what
the doctors do, and I must do it,” said Pina, as she poured
out a large dose of valerian and coaxed the sufferer to drink
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>As before, the powerful sedative quickly took effect.
And Drusilla let her maid lead her to her resting chair
near the window, and seat her in it, and put a foot cushion
under her feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, mist’ess, sit there and be quiet. I wouldn’t lay
down on the bed too much. It isn’t good for you. Sit by
the window and look out at the Lord’s good sunshine.
Bless you, the sun shines still, spite of all the fools
and wilyuns in the world. And here, I’ll bring you your
Bible and set it on your little stand before you. You used
to take comfort in your Bible. Lor’! if we only loved <i>Him</i>
half as well as we do some of his onworthy creeturs we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>needn’t have our hearts broke by ’em,” said Pina, as she
made the arrangement she proposed. But her last sentiment
was spoken <i><span lang="it">sotto voce</span></i> and did not reach the ears of
her inattentive mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead of deriving the consolation from the sacred
volume which indeed she was too much overcome to seek,
Drusilla dropped her head upon its open pages and seemed
to pray, or weep, in silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To think, when she gets wiolent, I have to knock her
down with a dose of walerian this way! It’s a most like
murder. And how’s it a gwine to end? I wish mammy
would come. I hope she ’aint got no engagement nowhere
else,” muttered Pina to herself as she went and made up
the bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>At noon it was a work of difficulty and of diplomacy for
Pina to get her mistress to swallow a few spoonfuls of the
chicken broth she had prepared for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the afternoon Drusilla was so much prostrated that
Pina assisted her to bed, and darkened the room, that she
might sleep, if possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Late in the evening Leo returned from Alexandria,
bringing with him a middle-aged, motherly-looking colored
woman, who called herself “Aunt Hector, honey,” but
whom Pina rushed to embrace as “mammy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as the overjoyed daughter had relieved her
mammy of bonnet, shawl and umbrella, and had sent them
by Leo with the “big box, little box, ban-box and bundle,”
up to the servants’ bedrooms over the kitchen, she set
about getting tea for the traveller.</p>

<p class='c011'>She laid a cloth upon which she arranged her own best
service, with cold ham, fried chicken, fresh butter, Maryland
biscuits, and, lastly, a pot of fragrant imperial.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Leo was out in the stable attending to his horses,
the mother and daughter sat down to the table together.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now what sort of a home is this here you’ve got here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>gal, where the marser is allus gone and the missus allus
grievin’ day in and day out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, mammy, you know as one follows the other; and
if the master’s always gone the mist’ess is likely to be
always grieving, if so be she cares for him, which our
mist’ess do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s he gone so much for? It looks bad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So it do, mammy, which it is bad too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what’s he gone <i>for</i>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He say business—let me see—connected—yes, that’s it—with
his late father’s will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Um hum; allus some excuse with them men. To begin
so airly, too; ‘fore he’s married a year. Lor’, I thought
you was agoing to have such a happy home, living fellow
sarvint with your own dear brother, long of a young married
pair with the highest of wages, and no ’sideration but
to live quiet and keep away company. But, deary me!
who can count on anything? Well, gal, I’m glad to get
leave to come to see you at last. But what can I do for
you? That boy, Leo, I couldn’t get nothink out’n him,
’cept ’twas the marser was allus gone and the missus was
allus grievin’, and you wanted me to come and nuss her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, mammy, that was it. And I hope you can stop
now you are here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I can stop fast enough. I have just got
through nussin Mrs. Porter with her fifth. And Liza Jane,
she’s out of service now and stopping home with me to
mend up her clothes; so she can take care of the house and
chillun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is sister Liza Jane and the rest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, they’s well enough. All had the fever ’n agur in
the airly part of the season, but when the frost came it
killed it. But where’s the young madam?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sleeping now, mammy. I had to give her a great big
dose of walerian.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>“<i>You—you</i> dare to dose a lady? Look here, gal, don’t
you set yourself up for a doctoress because your mammy’s
one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’, mammy, what’s walerian? I’ve seen you give it
to ladies for the hysterics by tea spoonfuls.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seen <i>me</i>? Yes, but I tell you what, gal, you’ve got to
p’izen a great many patients before you can be trusted to
give physic like an ole ’oman. But don’t you try that on
again, gal, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’, mammy, what on the yeth was I to do with her,
when she was raving distracted mad a-most? a pacing up
and down the room a tearing of her beautiful hair out by
the roots, and wringing and a twisting of her fingers often
her hands all but! I ’clare to the Lord and man I was
’fraid of my soul as she’d dash herself against a wall, or
fling herself out’n the window. And nothing on yeth but
walerian would quell her. That’s the reason I sent for you.
I didn’t like to take the ’sponsability to keep on a knocking
of her over with that there weepon; but I couldn’t let her
’stroy herself neither, so I had to give it to her, whether or
no, till you came.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what on the yeth did the creetur take on so about?
Not <i>his</i> being away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it was, mammy. His being away and his disappointing
of her by not coming back when he promised.
Men is such wilyuns!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And wimmin is sich fools! For my part, when the
chillun’s well the men may go to Old Nick for me! But
she ’aint got no chillun to comfort her, poor young thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not <i>yet</i>, mother,” said Pina, significantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Not yet?’ What do you mean, gal? <i>Soon will!</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, mammy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t know exactly; neither does she; but soon; and
that’s another reason why I sent for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>“Um hum. Well, if that’s so, she’s not to be let to go
raving and tearing about, let who will come or stay away,”
said the wise woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>The abrupt entrance of Leo put an end to this part of
the gossip.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy sat down at the table and took his tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, mammy,” said Pina, “as it’s late and you’re
tired, I’ll show you where you are to sleep. <i>I</i> shall have to
stop in the room with the mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And mind you, don’t give her any more physic, ’out
calling me fust,” said mammy, as she followed her daughter
up to the little room above the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina dismissed Leo to the stable loft, fastened up the
house, raked out the kitchen fire, and then returned to her
mistress’s chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poor little lady was in a troubled sleep, broken by
fitful sighs and sobs, and muttered words of which “Alick”
was the only one to be distinctly heard.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina just loosened her own clothes and sat down in the
lounging chair by the side of the bed to watch or sleep, as
the case might be. She slept, of course; and her sleep was
so deep that she did not know her, mistress awoke and arose
a little after midnight and paced the floor, weeping and
wringing her hands, until daylight, when she fell exhausted
upon the bed and dropped into a short and fitful slumber,
disturbed with gasps and starts.</p>

<p class='c011'>By sunrise Pina opened her own eyes, and seeing her
mistress lying very much as she had left her when she fell
asleep, the girl arose and replenished the fire and went
down into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here she found “mammy” making herself at home and
in full blast before the range getting the breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, and when am I to see the madam, I’d like to
know?” inquired Aunt Hector.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Soon’s ever she wakes, mammy; which you know you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>couldn’t see her last night, ’pon account of you being tired
and she sleepy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is she this morning?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sleeping like an angel, which so she’s been a doing of
all night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Um hum, you been a giving of her more o’ that
walerian!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deed I aint, mammy, which she hasn’t needed of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Pina and her mother and brother had had their
breakfast, the girl prepared some rich and delicate chocolate
and some nice light muffins for her mistress’s morning
meal, and took them up to the lady’s chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla was awake, though pale and worn.</p>

<p class='c011'>After having bathed her face and hands with diluted
Florida water, she consented to take a little of the refreshments
that Pina brought and sat upon a stand by her bedside.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Drusilla sat up in bed and sipped her chocolate,
Pina broached the subject of her mother’s presence in the
house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mist’ess, I want to tell you, ma’am, as my ole mammy
has come to see me, a little bit. I hope you has nothing
of no objection <i>now</i>, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“None in the world, Pina. Mr. Lyon——” She had
nearly broken down and wept again when she pronounced
his name; but she gasped, recovered herself and went on—“Mr.
Lyon used to object to having even your relatives
come to the house, but now that he is not here their coming
or going can make no difference.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you don’t object on your own account, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Pina, no; I don’t. It is good to have your mother
to come to see you. I wish, oh, how I <i>do</i> wish I had a
mother to come to see me, in my great trouble!” she added,
with a little sob.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tears rose to Pina’s eyes, as she answered:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>“My mammy is only a poor colored ’oman; but indeed,
ma’am, if you will let her, she will do for you as loving and
as tender as any mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will she stay with you long, Pina!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She would like to stay some weeks, if you would let
her, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She can stay as long as she likes, for your sake, my
good girl. But your mother—she must be in years,
Pina?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s past fifty, ma’am, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is she—experienced?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beg pardon, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is she—wise, skillful, knowing, I mean, about sickness
and about children?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! yes, ma’am, which that is her perfession, brought
up to it, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I think it very providential that she is here now.
Oh, I am very inexperienced and helpless! Pina, I think
I should like to see your mother and have a little talk with
her. When you take away this service you may bring her
up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes, ma’am! thank you, ma’am. She’ll be so glad
to pay her ’spects to you,” said the girl, delighted that the
proposal she had so much dreaded to make, had been so
kindly received.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the moment Pina left the room, Drusilla fell back
upon her pillow in a storm of sobs and tears, and gasping
forth at intervals:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick! Alick dear, to leave me at such a time as
this, and I so friendless and so ignorant, I might die! I
wish I could!”</p>

<p class='c011'>After a few moments, hearing footsteps on the stairs, she
ceased sobbing, and tried to compose herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina discreetly knocked at the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait a moment,” said Drusilla, wiping her eyes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>smothering the last convulsive throes of her bosom. And
then——“Come in,” she called.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina entered, showing in her mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla turned with forced calmness to welcome the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you do? What is your name?” she inquired,
in a gentle tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My name’s Aunt Hector, honey, ladies’ nuss, which I
have recommendments to show from the head doctors,
ma’am,” answered “mammy,” curtseying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think it very fortunate for me that you are here. I
hope you will be able to stay with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which it is my intention so to do, long as I shall be
wanted, honey, and no longer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, I would like to talk with you a little. I
have no mother, and I am as ignorant as a child of many
things I ought to know—Pina, my good girl, you may leave
the room, and you needn’t come back until you are called.
I wish to speak in private to this good nurse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Pina left the room and closed the door behind her,
mammy turned to her patient, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope, ma’am, that gal does her duty, which it is
always my pride and ambition to bring up my chillun so to
do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is a very good girl, and pleases me perfectly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am oncommon glad to hear it, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now I wish to speak to you of——” Drusilla hesitated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, honey, I understand. Speak out and don’t mind
me. I’m an ole nuss, you know, chile.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus encouraged, Drusilla began to speak of the
state of her own health, of her youthful inexperience, and
of her forlorn circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>In doing this she tried to cover the sin of her guilty
husband, by explaining his absence in the stereotyped manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>that he himself had often used, and putting it upon the
ground of “business connected with his late father’s will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But this effort was too much for her superficial composure.
The very name of Mr. Lyon overthrew her self-control.
In speaking of him her voice faltered, then she
choked, gasped and broke into a violent fit of sobs and
tears that shook her fragile frame almost to the point of
dissolution.</p>

<p class='c011'>The nurse was much too wise to coax or scold her patient.
But the sly old fox, who had blown her daughter up for
meddling with dangerous drugs, went herself and mixed a
composing draught for the sufferer—and not of the harmless
valerian that had been administered by Pina, but of potent
morphine that in a few moments sent Drusilla into a sleep
that lasted all that afternoon and night.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, ah! when she did at length awake, on this the third
morning after the great blow had fallen on her, she awoke
but to the renewal of anguish intolerable; of sorrow that
refused to be comforted; of despair that had forgotten the
very existence of hope.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It would be too painful to follow the young and deeply
wronged wife through the first weeks of her great trouble.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were passed in paroxysms of vehement and inconsolable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>sorrow, alternating with periods of dull stupor, partly
the result of reaction from high excitement, and partly the
influence of the nervine sedative administered by her nurse.</p>

<p class='c011'>The course pursued by this woman in the treatment of
her young patient was upon the whole very judicious. She
did not lecture her on the subject of her inordinate abandonment
to grief and despair. But she artfully drew her
attention away from the contemplation of her troubles, to
the consideration of those last and most important preparations
for the arrival of the little expected stranger, in which
mothers and nurses usually find such absorbing interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>She amused the youthful matron with certain necessary
alterations in the arrangements of her chamber, with fitting
up of an adjoining room as a nursery, with the decorating
and furnishing of an infant’s basket, and a berceaunette or
wicker cradle, and with the arranging of the liliputian wardrobe
in a beautiful miniature bureau.</p>

<p class='c011'>In these natural and pleasing occupations, Drusilla found
some relief from her heavy sorrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>The late October weather was glorious with all the gorgeous
splendor of the Indian summer, glowing through the
heavens and the earth, and kindling up the foliage around
the wildwood home with a beauty and refulgence of color,
richer and brighter than those of spring or summer.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the advice of the nurse, Drusilla every morning
took a short drive through the woods, and every afternoon a
slow saunter into the flower garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under happier auspices, this child of nature would have
derived much enjoyment from the season and the scene.
Even in her misery she felt something of their soothing
and cheering influence.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the beneficial effect of this course was soon apparent
in her. Her paroxysms of grief became less frequent and
violent. Her nerves grew calmer, and her brain clearer.
With this healthy reaction came reflection. She thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>upon the fixed past, the troubled present, and the doubtful
future.</p>

<p class='c011'>She now exonerated Alexander of all blame in his cruel
neglect of her. He thought, she mused, that their marriage
was illegal, and therefore he was just in his avoidance of
her. He knew that the separation would go near to kill
her, and therefore he was merciful in gently loosening the
tie, instead of suddenly wrenching it apart. He felt that
loving and tender letters would but melt and weaken her
heart, and therefore he was wise in writing shortly and
coldly. No doubt he suffered—poor Alick! as much as she
did, though he would not add to her distress by telling her
so. He had loved her so much! so much! and now he was
heroic in his self-restraint for her sake! So she justified
him to her own heart. For to honor him was with her
even a greater necessity than to love him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she wondered that he did not tell her the reason why
he thought his marriage with her was illegal. And more
than all she wondered what that untold reason could be.
Her conjectures wandered over every possible and impossible
theory of the case:</p>

<p class='c011'>First, that Alexander while at college, or while in
Europe, had contracted a secret marriage; that when he
wedded her he believed himself a widower; and that he
had recently discovered the existence of his first wife. But
this theory was no sooner conceived than rejected; for she
remembered that he had been solemnly betrothed to his
Cousin Anna from her earliest youth, and that upon his
return from Europe he had been about to marry her, when
the wedding was arrested by the death of his father.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly, that this very pre-contract to Anna Lyon,
might have rendered his marriage with her (Drusilla)
illegal. But this was also set aside as unreasonable, for
she recollected that the contract had been broken by Miss
Lyon, as he himself had assured his bride.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>Thirdly, that Alexander had discovered some very near
blood relationship between himself and his wife that made
their union unlawful. But this was at once repudiated as
quite impossible, for she knew his genealogy, as well as her
own, could be too distinctly and too far traced to admit of
such an idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>So imagination traversed the whole field of possibility and
impossibility, and found nothing to invalidate her marriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she came to this conclusion: (and in it her instinct
sided with her reason)—that there never had existed any
sort of impediment to her union with her husband, and her
marriage was perfectly lawful and righteous.</p>

<p class='c011'>And <i>now</i> did she blame him?</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh no! she ascribed his whole conduct to——</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Monomania!</span></p>

<p class='c011'>And when she found this answer to her inexplicable
riddle, she could have sung and danced for joy!</p>

<p class='c011'>Her marriage was not illegal; it was only private. And
her adored husband was not faithless; he was only mistaken.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had been told of monomania—she had heard how
men might be a little insane for a time upon one single
subject, while perfectly sane upon all others. She knew
also that this was not a dangerous type of madness, but
was often only the transient effects of fever, passing off
with returning health. She wondered whether he had been
ill.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under this view of the case, she resolved to write to him.
True, he had forbidden her to do so; and even assured her
it would be useless for her to write, as he was about to leave
Richmond for a tour through the counties.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she reflected he must have left directions at the Richmond
post-office to have his letters forwarded to him
wherever he should be, and her letter directed to Richmond
would be sent after him with the rest of his correspondents’.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>So she sat down and wrote him a letter—patient, loving,
pitiful, and even cheerful; gravely reasoning with him
upon the fallacy of his idea that their marriage could possibly
be unlawful; playfully inviting him to return that she
might convince him how very righteous and legal their
union was; then tenderly pleading with him to come and
be with her in her approaching hour of trial and danger.
She said no word, dropped no hint of the bitter anguish his
letter had inflicted upon her, of how nearly her brain
had been crazed, her heart broken, and her life lost in
despair. Nothing that could possibly distress him did
she write; but all she could think of to convince, comfort
and cheer him. And she prayed Heaven to bless him;
and she signed herself his true wife, for time and for
eternity.</p>

<p class='c011'>When she had sent off this letter, which she did early
on a splendid morning of the last days of Indian summer,
she felt so hopeful and so light-hearted, that she
longed for a pleasant gossip with some one. So she rang
for her old nurse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, honey! gracious knows it does me good to see
you so chirping!” said the old woman, dropping cozily
into a soft, low chair by the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse,” said Drusilla, cautiously approaching the subject
that now occupied her thoughts—for she was determined
to keep her husband’s name out of the question—“nurse,
in all your professional experience did you ever
encounter monomaniacs?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Count—<i>which</i>, honey? ‘Many money knacks?’
What’s that? tricks to make money? No, child, I can’t
say as I ever did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I meant to ask,” said Drusilla, smiling, “if in all
your tending of the sick in these many years you ever
met with anybody who was mad on one subject only and
sane on all others.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>“Cracked in one place? Yes, child, many and many
a one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me about them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was young Rowse Jordan—I mean young Mr.
Rowsby Jordan. He had typhoid fever, and after he got
well for ever so long he fancyfied himself to be a coffee-pot
and sat roosted upon the top of the table with one
arm curved around for a handle and the other stuck out
straight for a spout.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How long did the hallucination last?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The—hally—which, honey?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tut! How long did he fancy himself a tea-pot?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Coffee-pot, honey—it was coffee-pot.—Oh, for days and
days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did he get quite well again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes, honey, and laughs now at his mad notion, for
he ’members all about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me some more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, there was a lady patient of my own who would
have it her legs was made of glass, and she kept them
propped up against the wall behind the bed and wouldn’t
let anybody come near for fear of breaking of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was her head right on other things?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As right as yours or mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And she got over it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, when she got well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse, tell me—When a person is mad upon one subject,
it is no sign that his mind is unsound, is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When his brain pan is cracked in one place, you
mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hi, honey, if a bowl leaks anywheres you can’t call it
whole, can you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, no more can’t you call a man’s brain pan
sound if it’s cracked ever so little,” argued the old woman.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>“But they get over it. You have proved to me that
they get over it,” said Drusilla, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes, they get over it. Bowls and brain pans both
may be mended.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse, such a monomania is only a temporary affair,
like the delirium of fever, is it not? It leaves no after ill
effects upon the mind, does it?” she eagerly inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy, who did not quite understand the question, but
perceived that her patient was, for some reason or other
unknown to her, troubled upon this subject, hastened to
soothe her by replying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lors, no, indeed, honey—not the leastest bit in the
world. ’Taint nothink, honey, only somethink to laugh at
when it’s all over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m so glad to hear that,” said Drusilla, with a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, honey, if you’ll scuse me, I’ll go down in the
kitchen and see arter the chicking jelly for your dinner. I
know as how that gal, Pina ’ll spile it if I leaves it to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, nurse, go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I ’vises of you, ma’am, to put on your hat and go
for a walk in the garden. It’s right to go out and joy these
fine days, which few of ’em will be left for this season, and
if there was you wouldn’t be likely to get the good of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks, nurse, I think I will take your advice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And mammy went down to her fancy cooking.</p>

<p class='c011'>And mammy’s young patient put on her hat and cloak,
caught up a little hand-basket and went out and took a
turn in the garden among the broad parterres of gorgeous
autumn flowers that studded the spacious lawn in front of
the house. She amused herself with carefully gathering
the falling seed and tying up each sort in a separate paper,
and putting it in her little basket, for future use.</p>

      <div class='line in2'>At a certain French cafe, where every one goes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are met in a well-curtained, warm <span class='fss'>CABINET</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Overlooking a street there, which every one knows.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>While the young, forsaken wife was occupying her
lonely hours with these simple pursuits, and waiting from
day to day to hear from her faithless husband, and hoping
against hope to see him, events were transpiring in
Washington calculated to have an important influence on
her destiny. They were but trifles in themselves, however
momentous in their effects. They were only a few
bachelors’ wine suppers, card parties, and such like means
of ruin. But that fate hangs upon trifles, is a truth as old
as the history of Eden lost for an apple.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the way of it:</p>

<p class='c011'>After Mr. Richard Hammond had received his final
dismissal from Miss Anna Lyon, “that unlucky dog,” as
his uncle called him, “fell among thieves.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Fell among thieves.</span> That is the best way to characterize
his misfortune in sinking again into the society of
that dissipated set of men who ate his dinners, drank his
wines, won his money, demoralized his habits and destroyed
his reputation.</p>

<p class='c011'>On a certain evening about this time, poor Dick entertained
a few of his “friends” at supper in his rooms, at
one of our fashionable hotels.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among his guests were Captain Reding and Lieutenant
Harpe, those two gallant officers of the Loafers’ Guard,
who had once affronted Alexander Lyon by obtruding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>themselves into his opera box, and afterwards insulted
Drusilla by following her home.</p>

<p class='c011'>A lady friend, whose husband, in his profane bachelor
days, had been present at this orgie, told me something of
what passed there.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the cloth was removed, and wines, liquors, olives,
hookahs, tobacco and cigars were placed upon the table, the
“gentlemen” became more than ever at ease.</p>

<p class='c011'>The conversation, that had wandered over the general
subjects of politics, field sports, operas, singers’ throats,
dancers’ feet and beauties’ points, now became personal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way, Hammond,” said Captain Reding, taking
the mouth-piece of his hookah from between his lips, and
speaking through a cloud of smoke, “I see by the ‘Valley
Courier,’ which I found upon your table, that Miss Lyon is
really going to marry that prig Alexander. Is it quite
true?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe so, sir,” said Dick, changing color, and helping
himself to a deep draught of cognac.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How the deuce was it that you let the heiress escape
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The heiress, sir? I am not a fortune hunter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, bosh! you know what I mean, well enough. Who
the deuce would ever accuse <i>you</i> of being a fortune
hunter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who, indeed? Fortune lavisher would fit you better!
Eh, my boy?” put in the gentleman who afterwards
reported this conversation, and who must therefore be
nameless.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But to return to the previous question,” said Reding,
“the previous question with an amendment. How was it
that you let the beauty elude you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The beauty, sir? I fail to comprehend you,” said
Dick, coldly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, bah!” exclaimed young Lieutenant Harpe, rushing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>recklessly into the subject, for he was very much the
worse for wine. “Why the deuce can’t you speak out
plainly, Cap’, and call people by their names?— Miss
Lyon! the beautiful Miss Lyon! the elegant Miss Lyon!
the accomplished Miss Lyon! the belle of the season! the
queen of the haut ton! the adored of Dick Hammond,
whom she also adores! the betrothed of Alick Lyon, whom
she abhors! And here’s to her!” And with this, he
tossed off a big bumper of brandy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s so!” said Reding, “and that being so, why
the mischief don’t you run off with the girl, eh, Hammy,
my boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now if Dick had not been drinking a great deal more
than was good for him, he would never have let his cousin’s
name come up in such a company. Even as it was, he
rather resented its introduction now, by keeping silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you hear me, Hammy, my boy?” persisted Reding.
“I asked you why—seeing she liked you so much
better than she did that rum curse she was engaged to
marry—why you didn’t cut him out and run off with the
girl?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the first place,” answered Dick, coldly, looking down
into his empty glass, “it is not to be presumed possible
that the ‘girl,’ as you ventured to call the lady, would
have consented to run off with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’d be blown to atoms if I hadn’t kidnapped
her!” burst forth young Harpe, who was very far gone in
inebriation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That would scarcely be practicable in the nineteenth
century and in Washington city, Lieutenant,” answered
Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” laughed Reding; “telegraph wires and detective
policemen have been the death and destruction of all gallant
enterprises of that sort. Neither do I think such a violent
measure would have been necessary in this instance. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>could have carried her off with her own consent, and nobody
on earth could have prevented <i>that</i>, as they were both
of age. Why didn’t you do it, my boy, eh? You haven’t
answered that question satisfactorily yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because he didn’t dare to!” recklessly interrupted
Harpe. “He’s one of the ‘faint hearts’ that will never
‘win fair lady.’ He didn’t dare to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will answer you in the words of another weak wretch
who was stung by sarcasm into crime:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I dare do <i>all</i> that may become a man;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who dares do <i>more</i> is none.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In other words, Messieurs, I am quite as incapable of running
off with another man’s betrothed as I should be
in making love to another man’s wife,” said Dick, very
gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hear! hear! hear!” shouted Harpe; “he wouldn’t
run off with another man’s betrothed! oh, no, not he! even
when he knows he loves her, and she him! oh, no! no!
sooner than he’d make love to another man’s wife. As for
me, I’d do either, as often as I could get a chance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, man alive,” said Reding to Dick, “we are not in
Spain, nor France, nor Germany, nor any other country
where betrothal is held to be almost as sacred as marriage;
we are in America, where betrothal means simply a conditional
engagement between a young man and young woman
to marry each other at a definite or indefinite time, <i>provided</i>
in the meanwhile neither party should happen to
meet with any one he or she likes better. Bosh! such engagements
don’t end in marriage once in ten times!
Under the circumstances, I don’t think you were bound to
respect the betrothal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I differ with you,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for me,” put in Harpe, defiantly, “I never in all
my life fell desperately in love with a woman, until some
other man called my attention to her merits by getting possession
of her himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>“You’ll end in getting the sausage meat you call your
brains blown out, some of these days, my fine fellow, if you
don’t take care of yourself,” laughed the nameless gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d like to know who’s going to do it!” swaggered
Harpe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some indignant husband or lover, of course.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let ’em try it,” crowed Harpe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think, Hammond,” continued Captain Reding,
“common gallantry required you to try your fortune with
that young lady.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish, Reding, that you would drop the subject here,”
said Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As she never took the least trouble to conceal her preference
for you over Lyon, I do not see why we may not
discuss the subject here. Why, Dick, it was evident to
everybody who saw you three together, that she loathed
Lyon and liked you. The thing was clear, it was patent,
it was <i>flagrant</i>, under the circumstances! Now, come,
Dick, honor bright! Why <i>didn’t</i> you marry her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have answered that question already.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph! Well! we all thought you would certainly
carry off the prize. Why, you were always following her,
hovering over her, waiting on her, and even apparently
making love to her, which, by the way, was not very consistent
with your present declaration that you would be incapable
of marrying another man’s betrothed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hear! hear! hear!” shouted young Harpe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is so,” frankly confessed Dick. “It is true that
I sunned myself too much in the light of that bright lady’s
smiles. It was the old, old story of the moth and the
flame. But no one was hurt except myself. I was smartly
singed. I should, perhaps, have been entirely consumed
but for a mercifully severe hand that took me away from
the fatal light and warmth of the flame, and put me out in
the cold and dark. And so—saved me.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>And, saying this, Dick lighted his hookah and withdrew
into a cloud of incense.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, Dick, talk prose, not poetry. We’re a practical
party here, we are! The mercifully severe hand that took
you away from the fire and put you out in the cold, was no
other than the fair lady’s hand that tendered you the traditional
mitten. I thought so!” laughed Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; it was the war-worn hand of a veteran soldier.
My uncle had me up before him one morning; actually
arraigned me in the most magisterial manner; set Alick’s
rights, Anna’s duties, and my own trespasses squarely before
me, and then appealed to my honor; to which, I need not
say, Messieurs, no one ever yet appealed in vain. I have
never seen my fair cousin since that day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite right, Hammond. I honor your principles,” said
the nameless gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ume-me-me!” groaned young Harpe, rising sanctimoniously.
“My brethren, let us <i>awle</i> unite in prayer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold your profane tongue, sir,” said Captain Reding,
pushing the mocker down into his seat. “And don’t drink
any more brandy! You’re crazy now. You’ll be under the
table presently.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sober as any man here,” laughed Harpe, dropping into
his chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Appealed to your honor, did he, Hammond?” said
Reding, turning to Dick. “Well, I suppose the word has
some meaning for you and for the gallant old gentleman.
But I wonder how Alick Lyon understands honor, and how
he reconciles it with his present course.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“His present course. What do you mean?” inquired
Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should have said the course he has pursued the whole
winter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was that? I don’t like Lyon. I can not now.
I all but hate him. But, still, I do not think him capable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>of doing anything dishonorable. He is too proud to do so,
for one thing,” said Alick’s generous foe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, may be so. But I’d like to know what his ideas
of honor are; or how he can <i>honorably</i> reconcile his position
in respect to Miss Lyon with his relations to the little beauty
at Cedarwood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The little beauty at Cedarwood!’” echoed Dick, in
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, little Drusa!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little Drusa—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, now, Dick, don’t you be Forestic, Murdochic,
Wallackic, or tragic after any of these schools. They’re
not in your line. So leave off echoing my words and staring
at me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you said something about a girl that he has got
hidden away at Cedarwood?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t believe it!” said Dick, bluntly. Then remembering
that he was the host speaking to his guest, he courteously
added: “You are mistaken, sir. Lyon, with all his
faults, is not a villain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who said he was? I didn’t. All I say is, that he has
got just the sweetest little beauty you ever saw in your life
cozily concealed in a pretty cottage orneé at Cedarwood.
And he is very fond of her, and she is entirely devoted to
him; and he calls her sweet love, and little Drusa. And
she is just the loveliest little creature the sun ever shone
upon, with a clear pale face, and lustrous dark hair and eyes,
of such unfathomable depths of passion and of thought that
she might well be supposed to be from the East, and be a
daughter of the Druses.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you <i>sure</i> of this?” asked Dick, with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll swear to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Who</i> is she then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! that I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>“<i>What</i> is she to him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t undertake to say. I’ll swear that this little
beauty is living under his protection in his house at
Cedarwood. But whether she is his wife, or his sister, or
his mother, or his maiden aunt, of course, I can’t tell.
Doubtless it is some highly respectable connection of that
sort, Mr. Alexander Lyon being master of the house. If
it was <i>you</i>, Dick, you see we should all know what to
think!” laughed Captain Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick Hammond had been gazing steadily into the face of
the speaker, and rubbing his own brows very thoughtfully
and occasionally frowning painfully. But now he suddenly
started up, struck his hand upon his forehead, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good Heaven! It must be Drusilla Sterling!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph! Forestic again! You know her then?” said
Captain Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Know her? I’ve known her from childhood. Poor
little thing! So this is what became of her!” said Dick,
in a voice of great pain, as he dropped dejectedly into his
seat again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How look here, you know; none of that! Don’t you
be gettin’ up any interest in her; because, you see, I’ve
made up my own mind that way. And when Lyon marries
I mean to take the pretty cottage and the pretty girl
both off his hands,” drawled Harpe, very drowsily, for he
was in the last stage of intoxication, and almost asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can so well afford that sort of thing, with your
lieutenant’s pay!” laughed “nameless.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is this girl, Dick, since you know her?” inquired
Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is as pure and good a girl as lives in this world.
And, gentlemen, if she is at Cedarwood, as you say, under
Alick’s protection, my life and soul on it, she is his wife, or
she believes herself to be such!” said Dick, earnestly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>almost angrily, as if he challenged even the thoughts of
men if they wronged the friendless girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one seemed disposed to contradict him in words, no
matter how much they may have differed from him in
opinion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But who is she then, Hammond?” persisted Captain
Reding, who never, if he could help it, left a point unsettled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla Sterling, a clergyman’s orphan; brought up in
Alexander Lyon’s family; a protegée of his mother, a pet
of his father. Little less than a year ago she disappeared
from her home, and could never be traced by her friends.
So she is with him, the hypocritical scoundrel! But she is
his wife, or thinks herself so! My life and soul on it, she
does, for she could not fall—she could not. I have known
her from her earliest childhood—the sweetest child that
ever lived—a little saint!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But are you sure she is the same with Alick’s girl?”
inquired Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear there is no doubt of it. The coincidence of
name and circumstance is so complete. I can’t think why
I didn’t recognize her when you first mentioned her;
though in truth I never heard her called Drusa, but
Drusilla; and I never thought of her as a woman, but
merely as a child, and most certainly couldn’t associate her
memory with any thoughts of license, but always with the
most sacred sanctities of home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Were you her lover in the past as you are her champion
in the present, Hammond?” laughed Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No—yes—I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Clear, to the point, and satisfactory, that answer!”
laughed the captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean to say that I loved her, but not in the sense
you mean. I loved her only as a great New Foundland
dog might love a baby; as a big brute like myself might
love such a little angel as she was,” said Dick, gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>“Oh, yes, all women are angels until they are—found
out!” mused Lieutenant Harpe, rousing himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did you say, sir?” coolly inquired Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I say,” defiantly answered Harpe, “that all women are
angels until they are found out, and then they are fallen
angels, every one of ’em!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speak for the women you know best, sir! for those you
have been brought up with; for those you associate with;
for those nearest and dearest to you. For, <i>of course</i>, of
them only <i>can</i> you speak from knowledge! As for me, I
judge a man and his family by his judgment of women.
He who traduces the sex defames his own mother—and his
sisters, wife, and daughters if he has them!” said Dick,
indignantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead of attempting a reply to this scathing rebuke,
the weak traducer of woman looked around on his companions,
with a tipsy smile, and winking knowingly, said:
“<i>I</i> don’t mind <i>him</i>, bless you! <i>He</i> don’t know what he’s
talking about; he’s <i>tight</i>—tight as ever he can be! He
wants to quarrel now; he’s always quarrelsome in his
cups!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And having delivered himself of this opinion, he crossed
his arms upon the table, dropped his head upon them, and
resigned himself to sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor Harpe, he has a very weak brain,” said Captain
Reding.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one else made any comment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Reding,” said Dick Hammond, turning to the captain,
“I want you to tell me how you discovered the residence of
this poor girl at Cedarwood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you see we first saw her with him at the opera.
It was quite early in the season, and they were in a private
box. Harpe and I were in the orchestra seats. When the
curtain fell on the first act we went around there to get a
nearer view of the pretty creature, hoping also to get an introduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>to her. But Lord bless you, Lyon scowled at us
as if he thought we had come to pick his pockets. We
wouldn’t take notice of his black looks, but by being perfectly
civil and self-possessed ourselves we compelled him to
treat us with something like courtesy. But it was <i>only</i>
something-like; it wasn’t the genuine article itself; for he
wouldn’t ask us to sit down, nor he wouldn’t present us to
the pretty girl. And from that day I don’t think he ever
brought her into the city again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then how did you discover her residence and her relations
to him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going to tell you. Some days after that we met
Lyon in the reading-room of the Brown House. We
chaffed him about the mysterious little beauty, you may be
sure. But he stopped us by telling us that she was the
daughter of a clergyman, and was only passing through the
city under his escort, and that she had returned to her
home in the country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A mere evasion, of course.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but we did not question the fact at the time;
although we did wonder how Alick come to be trusted with
the escort of a young lady.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should think so. Pray go on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A little later we discovered the truth by chance. I
went to spend a few days with an acquaintance I have
living about a mile from Cedarwood. And while there,
guided by some negroes, I went on a coon-hunt by torch-light.
Did you ever see a coon-hunt by torch-light?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Often, when I was a boy; never since.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, the sport was quite new to me, and as a natural
consequence I got separated from the dogs and darkies, and
got lost in the woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A good beginning for an adventure,” said the nameless
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. Well, to resume—while I was trying to find a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>path, I saw a bright, indeed a brilliant light, shining
through the trees at some distance. I went towards it, and
found a beautiful cottage ornée, with its front windows
splendidly illuminated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was a party,” said one of the guests.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; though as it was now between two and three
o’clock in the morning, on seeing the lighted windows I
was struck with the same thought. They are having a
blow out in there, I said to myself. But it was nothing of
the kind, my friends!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was it, then?” inquired Dick, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait till I tell you. I pushed on towards the house,
and when I came up to it, I saw no carriages, no servants,
no life, no motion. Everything was as still as death. In
fact, the whole house was closed up except the two brilliantly
illumined windows, from which the light streamed
far across the lawn, and deep into the woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go on! go on!” said Reding’s companions, speaking
in a chorus. And the captain, who had only paused to
take a drink, continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Well,’ I said to myself, ‘this is rum go, anyway!’
And after walking around and around the pretty place,
without seeing or hearing anything, I just climbed up to
the window-sill and peeped through the lighted window.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here the captain paused for pure aggravation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! well! what did you see?” exclaimed several
voices.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did I see? Ah, my friends, I had a full view
of a small terrestrial paradise! and a beautiful mortal
houri! a little domestic Eden, with a sweet little Eve
within it! an enchanted bower, with a sleeping beauty!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do speak plainly, Reding! that’s a good fellow!” said
the nameless gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, I saw a nice, cozy drawing-room, the very
picture of elegance and comfort; a fine fire of sea coal in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>the grate; a luxurious little supper set forth in a splendid
service on a round marble table; by its side an easy chair,
and a pair of slippers; at a short distance and nearer the
chimney corner a little stand, with an astral lamp and some
books; and near it a lovely young creature, reclining in a
resting chair, fast asleep, with the book she had been reading
fallen upon her lap.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a beautiful picture,” said one of the company,
while the others listened in silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I immediately recognized the beauty of the opera box;
but as I live, gentlemen, I did not then connect her in my
thoughts with Alexander Lyon. On the contrary, I
believed his account of her, and I said to myself—‘There
is the little darling waiting up for her clerical papa, who
has gone to make a pastoral call on some one of his parishioners
who is dying.’ And I hung there by the sill of the
window, and looked in and fed my eyes upon the sweetness
of the scene.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well? what then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I heard horse’s feet coming. ‘Papa is returning,’
I said to myself. And I dropped from the sill and hid myself
in some thick bushes below it, to wait till papa should
pass, so that I might make my retreat unobserved. It
appears that the horseman went first around to the stable;
for soon I heard rapid footsteps approaching the house.
And you may judge my surprise when I saw a young man
run lightly up the stairs, and saw the door fly open, letting
out a flood of light, and the little beauty rush into the arms
of the new comer, whom I then plainly recognized as
Alexander Lyon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great Heaven!” exclaimed Dick Hammond, in agitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As if it had not been enough to know him by his face
and form, I had his voice also in evidence of his identity.
‘Are you as glad to see me as all this, my little Drusa?’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>he asked. And she answered with a shower of soft caresses
and silvery tones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then?” inquired Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, then, of course, the house swallowed them up.
The door was shut and locked, and the brilliant windows
were darkened, and they had their happiness all to themselves,
while I was left out in the cold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You could not have been mistaken in what you supposed
you saw and heard?” inquired Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; how could I? That was not the only time I
looked in at those windows either. A sort of fascination
drew me there, to look in upon that lovely young creature.
While I remained in the neighborhood, under the cover of
coon hunting, I paid a visit to the lighted windows every
night. Ah! night after night! night after night did that
sweet little creature sit there waiting for him, leaving the
windows open to guide him home, and keeping his supper
warm, while he, sorry dog, was engaged gallanting Miss
Anna about to balls and theatres, and scowling at better
men than himself if they so much as looked at the belle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Reding, I am deeply grieved to hear this; scarcely less
so than I should be if the poor child were my own sister.
But I repeat and reiterate most emphatically this truth,
that she is really his wife, or believes herself to be so!”
said Dick, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think you are quite right, Hammond! The young
creature herself, and all her surroundings breathed so
sweetly of what you called ‘the sanctities of home life’ that
no one looking on her could think evil of her. Indeed I
thought evil of <i>myself</i> though, sometimes, for seeming to
play the spy. But I couldn’t resist the temptation of looking
into that beautiful interior. I meant no harm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your contraband pastime was never discovered?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes,” laughed Reding. “She rose once and turned
round so suddenly, that she saw me before I could drop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>from my perch. She screamed and disappeared; and I
could have scourged myself for frightening her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then, I suppose, your stolen visits ceased.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a bit of it. I was only more cautious. But one
night I purposely let myself be seen by <i>him</i>, on a rare
occasion, when he happened to come home before daylight.
It was to be my last visit, for I was about to leave the
neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did he know you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! for as soon as he got a glimpse of my face, he
blazed away at me with his revolver, and you may rest
assured, I didn’t stop to claim his acquaintance! All, he
had a good chase after me, and I had a good run and a good
laugh! When I returned to the city, I couldn’t keep the
joke to myself. I had to tell Harpe, for which I was afterwards
sorry; for the scurvy fellow, with a party of his companions,
having met the poor little girl in the city after
Lyon had left, took advantage of her unprotected state and
followed her home, and would have intruded into her house,
if they had not been prevented by her servants.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Reding,” said Dick, gravely, “after what I have told
you of this young lady, I hope and trust that you will
abstain from speaking of her anywhere, and from doing
anything to annoy her at any time. In a word, I appeal to
your manhood, to treat her in all respects as you would
treat the most honored woman of your acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never wished to do otherwise, and as I never expect
to see the little angel again, I shall never have a chance of
doing otherwise. But here, I declare, the day is breaking!
And we ought to do the same! Wake up, Harpe! Come!
Good night, Hammond!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the party separated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick Hammond remained, walking up and down the
room in deep thought. At length he took a sudden resolution—to
seek Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c006'>The greenness of the grass, the freshness of the flowers,
and the splendor of the sunshine, still lingered; the glorious
Indian summer still lived on through the gorgeous
month of October, and even staid to welcome the arrival
of sad November.</p>

<p class='c011'>At high noon, one day about this time, Drusilla was sauntering
slowly through her garden, trying to gather strength
and comfort from the beauty and refulgence of the scene
and hour, when she suddenly heard the outer gate open.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked up to see the cause, and she started violently
and changed color; for she saw—</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Richard Hammond!</p>

<p class='c011'>He was now walking up the avenue towards the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>On seeing him, her first natural emotion was that of
astonishment; her first clear impression was that he came
from her husband on some errand to herself. All in a tumult
of delight, she hastened to meet him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Alexander Lyon, I believe,” said Dick, at a hazard,
and respectfully raising his hat as he came on to greet her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that is my now name,” answered the young matron,
with a smile and a blush of happiness, not of confusion, as
the questioner particularly noticed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew it!” he exclaimed, emphatically and involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Knew what? knew me?” she inquired, pleasantly.
“Of course you did. Why should you not? It has been
but two years since we met. And I knew <span class='fss'>YOU</span> at a glance.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>“Very likely; for an old fellow like myself does not
change in two years, while a young lady like you grows up
and gets married in the meantime, which makes <i>some</i> little
difference,” answered Dick, archly, partly to cover his confusion
at having spoken his thoughts aloud, and partly to
procure her confirmation of what he firmly believed—namely,
that she truly or falsely imagined herself to be a wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes,” she replied, still blushing and smiling, “I am
married; and as you know that fact, which you could have
learned only from my husband, of course you come from him.
He is well?” she inquired, anxiety now betraying itself in
her look and tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite well,” said Dick, who was now beginning to feel
the embarrassment of the duty he had taken upon himself
to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you bring me a letter from him? I have been
looking for one by the mail; but I am glad he sent it by
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick hesitated and looked confused.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give me my letter, please,” she said, holding out her
hand with a smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Mrs. Lyon, I regret to say I have no letter for
you,” he answered, as calmly as he could.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No letter!” she repeated, with a look of disappointment;
and she sank down in the garden seat, because from
excess of emotion she was unable to stand. Then, soon
brightening up with new hope, she exclaimed—“Oh, then,
he has charged you with a message for me! Sit down
here and tell me all he says.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick took the offered seat, but remained silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How, then, Mr. Hammond, tell me! tell me quickly
what does Alick say? And, oh, forgive my impatience!
but it has been so long since I have heard from my husband,
and I have been so uneasy about him!” she said,
and her hurried tones, her eager face and trembling frame,
all betrayed the excess of anxiety that agitated her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>But Dick Hammond sat silent and immovable, cursing
the fate that had thrust upon him a duty he found so hard
to perform.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why don’t you answer me? Why are you silent?
Why do you look so strangely, avoiding my eyes? What
is the matter? Oh, Heaven, what has happened?” she
cried, turning pale and beginning to twist her fingers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Lyon,” said Dick, with an effort, “I have
neither letter nor message from Alexander.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neither letter nor message from my husband? I
thought you came from him! I thought you came with
his sanction. Else why are you here at all?” she asked,
shivering with a vague alarm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam!” cried Dick, jumping up, flushing red, and,
between his pity for her and his rage at Alick, losing all
his self-command; “Madam, I came here to tell you that
Alexander Lyon is a reproach to his name and to manhood!
and totally unworthy of your regard, or of the notice of
any honest woman!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla was struck dumb.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a few moments she gazed at him in blank wonder,
while he strode up and down the garden walk before her,
wiping his brows and trying to subdue his excitement.
Then she arose slowly, stretched out her arm, and pointing
to the outer gate said, quietly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leave this place, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped in his furious walk and looked at her. She
had ceased to speak, but was still standing pale and grim
and pointing his way out.</p>

<p class='c011'>He felt that he must keep his ground, and do his duty at
any cost. He was sorry that his own rashness had raised
obstacles in his path. He approached her and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, I take back my words. I beg your pardon for
having uttered them. I will beg it on my bent knee to
content you. Forgive me, and consider my rash words unsaid.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>“Indeed, I know not how to forgive you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But when penitence is professed and forgiveness asked,
it is a Christian’s duty to extend it,” said Dick, appealing
to her conscience.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Admit, then, that your words—the injurious epithets
you dared to apply to my husband—were untrue.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do <i>you</i>, who have so much trust in him, need to be
assured that they were untrue?” inquired Dick, evasively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, indeed, I do not. I know that Alexander Lyon is
the very soul of honor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick bowed deeply and a little ironically, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you require a fuller apology than I have yet
made?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I make it. I feel very sorry that I forgot myself
so far as to use those terms in respect to the gentleman in
question. I take them back unreservedly, and I beg you,
as you are a Christian, to forgive me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She bowed, still a little coldly, and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, I know that you have come here this morning, if
not directly from my husband, at least in his interests, or
upon his affairs. If you are an authorized agent, pray explain
the nature of the business that has brought you here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Under the forced calmness of her words he perceived that
a terrible anxiety was torturing her soul. He answered
gently:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, yes, I come here on his affairs and in his interests,
since it is certainly important to him that he be
prevented from taking a certain step that he contemplates.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What step is that?” she breathlessly inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you permit me first to see you into the house?
The explanation I have to make is not a pleasant one, and
you are already something overcome by what has passed.
You had better hear the rest of what I have to say in your
own parlor.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>Drusilla hesitated. She still resented the words he had
used in reference to her husband, although he had recanted
and begged pardon; and for this reason she shrank from
taking him across the threshold of her house. But she reflected
that, as he had assured her he came upon Alexander’s
affairs and in his interests, she could do no less than
open her doors to his entrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, then,” she said, rising and leading the way into
the cottage.</p>

<p class='c011'>She walked very fast, her impatience overcoming her
weariness.</p>

<p class='c011'>She showed him into the drawing-room and signed him
into a seat, and sank herself down on a corner of the
sofa, for she was quite out of breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, now, Mr. Hammond,” she exclaimed, as soon as
she could articulate the words. “Explain yourself! I
know well, I knew from the first, that you did not come
here for the sole purpose of making me a call. I feel now
that the nature of your errand is painful. Tell it at once.
You must know that anything is better than suspense.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick attempted to answer, but looked in her face and
failed. It was as hard to obey her as it would have been
to gaze in the eyes of a lamb and slay it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Still silent?” she said, clasping her hands. “Ah,
Heaven, do not torture me so! I have suffered so much
already! so much, just Lord! I can bear no more! Tell
me your worst news at once, and kill me with it. It would
be mercy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Still, still, Dick’s answer, like Macbeth’s amen, “stuck
in his throat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Heaven, what is this? Why don’t you speak?
Alick! Alick! my husband! You said that he was well!
Yes, you said so! But they say of the <i>dead</i> that they are
well!” she cried, clasping her hands, and in her excessive
alarm forgetting that Dick had certainly, in the early part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>of their interview, spoken of Alick as a living man about to
take an objectionable step.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her complexion curdled into white and livid spots, her
features quivered with the intense agony of suspense, as
she stretched out her hands and gasped forth the word:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell—tell—is Alick—<span class='fss'>DEAD</span>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No!” thundered Dick, emphatically, as he found his
voice, “he is not! No such good luck. The rope is not
ready for him yet,” he added, under his breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>She heard only the first words of his reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank Heaven for that, at least. It is well to know
that. I think now I can bear everything else,” she sighed,
as the tension of her nerves relaxed, and she sank down
among the cushions and closed her eyes. This reaction
from her illogical but deadly terror was so great, that she
nearly swooned. And now to feel certain that he was alive
and well seemed all sufficient for her satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick did not disturb her by a word, look, or gesture. He
was pleased to put off the evil hour of explanation as long
as possible, even if it were to be forever; and he mentally
bemoaned the hardship of the duty he felt compelled to do,
and he wished himself anywhere else but where he was.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a few minutes Drusilla recovered herself, and with an
effort sat up and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Hammond, you assure me that my husband is
alive and well; as indeed I ought to have known from your
previous conversation; only that in my sudden alarm I did
not remember it. I am not very rational, I think. But
now that my fears for his safety are set at rest, I do not
dread to hear any other ill news that you may have to tell
me. So speak out freely and without fear for me. I am
strong enough to sustain the shock of common calamities,”
she added, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in saying these words, she only thought of Mr.
Lyon’s supposed lawsuit, “connected with his late father’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>will,” and she fancied that Dick had come to tell her of its
failure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I will do so, Mrs. Lyon—Drusilla! I wish you
would let me call you so, as I used to do when you were a
little child,” said Dick, gently and gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may call me anything that my husband will
permit, Mr. Hammond. But until you have his sanction,
you must call me Mrs. Lyon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, my dear child,” said Dick, mournfully, “I fear that
is the very last name he will be willing to accord you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it that you say, sir? What do you mean?”
questioned Drusilla, in a low, breathless, hurried tone, as
with his words there rushed upon her mind the recollection
of her husband’s cruel letter, in which he had declared his
union with her to be illegal, null and void, and to have
always been so. And now she instantly connected Hammond’s
visit and his untold news with that letter and its
cruel communications. And she wondered if Dick knew
anything about Alick’s supposed monomania; and if so,
whether he rightly understood it, or whether he was misled
by it.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Dick did not immediately answer her questions, she
spoke to him again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why do you not reply to me, Mr. Hammond?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, my poor child! my dear child! you readily surmised
that I had painful matters to communicate, but you
never divined how painful,” said Dick, sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You alarm me again. For Heaven’s sake, speak and
shorten this torture,” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You believe yourself to be the wife of Alexander
Lyon?” said Dick, modulating his voice to a tone of the
deepest and most respectful sympathy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘<i>Believe</i>,’ sir? I am so,” answered Drusilla, drawing
herself up with a proud and confident smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I feel assured that you think as you say. My long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>knowledge of you, my earnest esteem for you will not
permit me to question your good faith. But my poor
Drusilla, my dear girl, I fear, I greatly fear that you are
mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not, sir. I cannot be mistaken on such a subject,”
answered Drusilla. And as all the deep dishonor implied
in the doubt rushed over her mind, her face and neck were
suffused with the crimson flush of wounded delicacy and
offended pride, and she added, “You must know, sir, that
to question my wifehood is to insult me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven is my witness, how far from my heart is the
wish to offend you, how profound and respectful is my sympathy
for you, and how deeply it pains me to give you pain.
But I must do my duty. Most willingly would I have
avoided this task, if I could have done so; but I could not.
And I come to serve and to save you, and one who is dearer
to me than all others besides,” said Dick, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I know why you speak to me in this manner.
You have suffered yourself to be misled by the transient
imaginings of a monomaniac, who is so sane on all other
subjects, and with one exception so strong and clear in
judgment and understanding, that you have failed to discover
his hallucination to be what it is. But I will soon
convince you that it is <i>you</i> who are mistaken, and not I,”
replied Drusilla, with much dignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>And she drew from her bosom the little black silk bag:,
took from it the small piece of paper and placed it in the
hands of her visitor, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, Mr. Hammond, read that, and confess that you
have alarmed yourself for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick, who had been listening to her and watching her in
wonder and curiosity, took the paper, and with a bow, began
to examine it. As he read it slowly and attentively, he
gathered his brows into a thoughtful and troubled frown,
and as he finished it, he looked at her with a compassionate
expression and inquired:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>“My dear child, how came this little document into your
keeping?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I found it while clearing out Alick’s dressing-glass
drawer. And as it was as much mine as his, and as he did
not seem to set much value on it, judging by the place in
which he left it, I took possession of it. And I am very
glad now that I have it to show you,” she answered, smiling
confidently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because you consider it a proof positive of your marriage?”
he inquired, gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, of course. And so it is,” she exclaimed, triumphantly.
“Why, look at it! Read it! It is quite plain and
conclusive! A child could comprehend it! Don’t you see
for yourself that this is the most positive proof of my marriage
that could possibly be produced?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Drusilla,” he answered, mournfully, “I see nothing
of the sort. Quite the contrary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you don’t understand English when you see it!”
retorted the sorely tried young creature, losing a little of
her saintly patience.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I understand <i>this</i>, but too well!” replied Dick, grimly
regarding the document that he still held in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In mercy’s name, what do you mean now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean that this piece of paper proves no marriage.
It only indicates that at the time of its being filled out,
Lyon probably had sincere intention to marry you. But so
far from its being a proof of your marriage, as it lies here
before us, it affords an incontrovertible evidence that no
such marriage ever took place!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come! what next, I wonder? Are you also a monomaniac
on this subject? And is madness infectious? If
so, pray leave my presence before you inoculate me with
the same mania!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would to Heaven that you were right and that I were
talking at random! But it is not so, Drusilla! ‘I speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>the words of truth and soberness.’ This document proves
that you were never married,” said Hammond, with as
much earnestness as sadness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are raving! In the name of reason how can you
talk so frantically? <i>That</i> paper, of all things in the
world, proves I never was married? Can <i>any</i> thing in the
universe prove that I was never married, when I know I
was? I am not a fool, or a lunatic, or a visionary, to
imagine things that never happened. I saw and heard
myself married to Alick by a regularly ordained minister,
with a special license, and in the presence of a dozen
witnesses. You talk wildly, Mr. Hammond! Yes, and
very offensively!” she added.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg you to forgive me and to bear with me, Drusilla,”
he answered sadly, “but——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call me by my husband’s name! I have a right to
it!” interrupted the young matron, proudly, but mournfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Heaven knows that you <i>have</i> a right to it! The
holiest, if not the most lawful right, and I cannot refuse
it to you. But, Mrs. Lyon, as I told you, I came here to
serve and to save <i>you</i> if possible, and also one who is
dearest of all to me; so in her service and in yours, I
must convince you of the truth of what I have just said,
however distressing it may be for me to press, or for you to
believe,” said Dick, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The earnestness and solemnity of his words deeply
impressed her. A new terror struck all the color from her
face—doubt, like the iron, entered her soul. She gazed at
him transfixed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is so,” said Hammond, turning away his eyes that
he might not meet the agonizing appeal in hers. “It is so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You <i>ought</i> to be, but you are <i>not</i> the wife of Alexander
Lyon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not his wife—not Alick’s wife! Oh, Alick, Alick! my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>own! my dear! my love! my husband! I <i>am</i> your wife!
I am—I am!” cried the wronged and wretched young
creature, with a sob and a gasp, as she sank back among
her cushions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick could have wept for company, but he only cursed
Alick and pitied her, while he watched and waited for her
to recover herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! how many tears she had shed in her short married
life of less than a year!</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently her anguish broke forth in a sharp and bitter
cry:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, oh why, do you say such terrible things to me,
Mr. Hammond?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because it is absolutely necessary that you should
know them,” he answered, kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you no pity—<i>none</i>—that you drive this sorrow-like
a sword into my heart?” she cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven knows how much pity and how much respect I
have for you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what—oh what,” she sobbed, wringing her hands
in her agony, “oh, what makes you say that I am not his
wife—not my dear Alick’s wife? When I told you—<i>I told
you</i> how I was married; with a special license, by a regularly ordained
minister, and in the presence of a dozen
witnesses? How <i>can</i> you say, in the face of all this, that
I am not Alick’s wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Drusilla, on my honor as a gentleman, by my
knowledge as a lawyer, and on my faith as a Christian, I
assure you, that though your nuptial ceremony had been
pronounced by a bishop, and in the presence of a thousand
witnesses, the very existence of this little document as it
lies before us proves that ceremony to have been illegal and
of no effect.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She clasped her hands and gazed on him with such a look
of unutterable woe in her voice, that he could no more bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>to meet her eyes than could the heroes of old endure Medusa’s
glance and live. Yet withal she was now very calm,
though with a calmness that was but a restrained frenzy;
but it must have deceived Dick as to her powers of endurance,
or he would not have driven the spear home to her
heart as in a few moments he did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Alick knew this?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not sure he knew it or thought of it on the
wedding-day. But I am sure that he knows it now,”
sighed Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so his fancy was a fact after all; and he was no
monomaniac?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, he was no monomaniac,” said Dick. “He was
only a scoundrel,” he added, under his breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alick knows this! Then this is the discovery he made
in March?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Probably, if he made any.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He told me he had discovered then our marriage was
not legal. He has absented himself from me ever since.
Heaven help me! I thought he was suffering from a
hallucination that would pass away. And it was a
reality!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it was,” said Dick, wondering at her apparent
composure and misled by it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But Alick will remedy the evil now. He will marry
me over again. You know he will, Mr. Hammond?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know he ought to do so; I know he is bound by the
holiest obligations that can bind a man to do so; I know if
he had one spark of honor in him he <i>would</i> do so; but I do
not believe he will,” growled Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How dare you say that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because if he had the slightest intention of doing you
justice, he would never even dream of the step he is now
actually about to take, and of which I came here on purpose
to warn you.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>“What step? You said something of this when you
first arrived. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A step which, (were you his wife, as you ought in justice
to be) would take him across the threshold of a
state’s prison, for it would be a felony,” answered Hammond,
speaking distinctly and emphatically, and hoping
that she would understand him, and save him the pain of a
more particular explanation.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she did not even suspect his meaning. She only
clasped her hands, and gazed at him with piteous and
beseeching eyes, and murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it? Speak plainly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned away his head that he might not witness her
despair, as he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is about to take advantage of the discovery he has
made by marrying Miss Anna Ly——”</p>

<p class='c011'>His words were cut short by a piercing shriek that rang
like the cry of a lost soul through the air. He started up
and confronted Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was standing before him, in motionless, speechless
anguish. Her face was blanched to the hue of death, her
eyes were dilated and strained, her hands were extended,
her form rigid. As one struck with catalepsy, for a moment
she stood thus, and then fell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hammond caught her before she struck the floor, and
laid her tenderly on the sofa, and then in great alarm, he
rang for assistance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her servants were at that hour gathered around the
kitchen table eating their dinner, and talking of the strange
visitor whom they had all seen enter the house in company
with their mistress. They heard the shriek that rang
through the air, followed by the loud peals of the parlor-bell,
and they started up in a body and ran to see what the
matter could be.</p>

<p class='c011'>They found their mistress in a swoon on the sofa, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>strange gentleman standing over her, beside himself with
fear and grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For Heaven’s sake do something. I fear Mrs. Lyon is
dying or dead!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What caused it, sir?” demanded “mammy,” putting
aside the intruder, and kneeling down to examine her
patient.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was so unhappy as to be the bearer of bad news to
her,” Dick confessed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, sir, you ought to a-knowed better than for to a-told
it to her in her state of health. It may a-killed her,”
said the nurse severely, as is the custom of her class in
rebuking the common  enemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick looked guilty and wretched.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pina pitied him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, mammy, it aint killed her—she aint dead; ’deed
she aint, mammy. She’s only in one of her fainty fits.
She’s subject to ’em, mammy,” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You hold your tongue, gal. What do you know?
Come here and help me to rub her hands. And Mr. Leo,
you go ’bout your business. What call you go to be poking
’round where there’s a lady sick? And <i>you</i>, sir,” said
mammy, turning to the unhappy Dick, “now you’s done
all the harm you can do, you go ’way too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick turned a long, lingering look to the inanimate form
on the sofa, and then reluctantly followed his companion in
banishment from the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they reached the hall, Leo politely opened the
front door for the exit of the visitor.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Dick loitered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come here, boy,” he said, beckoning Leo close to his
side. “Is your mistress realty subject to these swooning
fits?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes sir; and so has been ever since master took to his
ways,” answered the boy, sulkily, because for the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>being he hated all mankind, and, most of all, his master,
for his mistress’s sake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What ways?” asked Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gentlemen’s ways, sir,” growled Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—she gets over these attacks?” asked Dick, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy looked at the questioner askance, and answered,
ironically:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Sir; slight as they is, she allus dies of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick smiled, even in the midst of his trouble, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, I pardon your impertinence for the sake of the
regard that I see you bear your mistress. Don’t mock me
again, but answer me truly—these swoons are not dangerous,
are they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir, I don’t think they is. The women allus gets
her out of ’em in an hour or so,” said Leo, somewhat mollified
by the sincere interest this stranger took in his mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, my boy, when your mistress is quite well, say to-morrow
morning, if she is well enough to be up, I wish you
to give her this packet,” said Dick offering Leo a large,
long, well-filled yellow envelope.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo backed several paces, and put his hands behind
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s that for?” inquired the visitor. “Why don’t
you take this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it a writ?” asked the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick laughed now.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, stupid! I have been more used to having writs
served upon <i>me</i>, than to serving them upon <i>others</i>. Do I
look like a bum baillie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, take this and give it to your mistress when
she gets better.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>But the boy backed farther, and kept his hands behind
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you crazy?” asked Dick, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir; but I want to know what is in that there
yaller hang-wallop, before I tetches of it to take it to my
mist’ess, ’cause she’s been put upon bad enough a’ready, the
dear knows,” said Leo, stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hammond good-humoredly opened the yellow envelope,
and for the boy’s satisfaction displayed its contents,
which consisted of two open letters, one sealed letter and a
newspaper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There,” he said, as he replaced them, “you see there is
nothing very dangerous in the packet. It is for your mistress’s
benefit that I wish to send it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir, I’ll take it to her; and I hope, sir, you’ll
’scuse me for hanging back and doubting,” said Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly; I respect your scruples, and I like you all
the better for your fidelity to your mistress. And now,
listen. I want you to do something else for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know the ‘Drovers’ Rest?’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it that little shady inn on the road, just before you
turn into our woods, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The very same; it is the only inn within half a mile.
I shall wait there until evening to hear how your mistress
is. Do you think you can slip across there to bring me
news of her this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll try, sir—yes, sir, I’ll come, sir,” said the boy, first
hesitating, and then consenting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. Don’t forget to do so,” said Mr. Hammond,
dropping a small gold coin into Leo’s hand, and then
hurrying from the house.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was long, very long, before the most strenuous and
persevering efforts of her servants could bring the stricken
and unconscious sufferer back to consciousness. As always
before, the return to sensibility was but the return to
sorrow. But the nurse prepared a dose of morphine, and,
murmuring to her of her babe, persuaded her to take it.
And soon she was buried in the blessed oblivion of sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo sat over the kitchen fire, wishing himself a man and
a white man, that he might avenge the wrongs of his worshipped
mistress. In his small way, very much as the
child Willie Douglas felt towards the beautiful and discrowned
Mary Stuart, felt this poor fellow towards the
wronged lady of his own allegiance. Late in the evening,
to him, sitting there, came Pina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, and how is she now?” inquired the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gone to bed. Mammy give her something to put her
to sleep. Mammy knows what to do. My goodness, Leo,
what a blessing it is that we fetched mammy to her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, indeed, that it was, Pina.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now you clear out here. I want to get some supper
ready for mammy to eat. She hasn’t had no dinner,
nor even a mortal bite since breakfast. My gracious, what
a tiresome thing it is to have a house always up side down
like ours. Just as if there was a somebody a being buried
or a being borned every day in the week! and all on
account of that man! Yes, I <i>will</i> call him ‘that man,’ if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>I’m hashed for it!—that man! that man! that man!
there, now! And I don’t see no use no men ever is, ’cept
’tis to make a fuss in the family! And I know as the
Lord made the wimmin; but I b’lieve in my heart and soul
the debil made all the men, jest to spile the Lord’s work!
And I wish there wasn’t a man in the world, ’cept ’tis <i>you</i>,
Leo, and Cousin Charley, and daddy! So there, now!
And now why don’t you go ’bout your business and leave
me room to move ’round the range and get supper?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo, with a certain sense of shame in belonging to that
offending and prescribed sex created by the devil for the
confusion of the world, gladly took himself out of the
kitchen and went to keep his appointment with his fellow
sinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>He found Mr. Richard Hammond in the little back parlor
of the suburban inn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick was seated at a table; with writing materials, and
also, alas! with brandy, tobacco and pipes before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your mistress? I hope she is better?” exclaimed
Dick, eagerly, on seeing his messenger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir; the wimmin, they have fetched her out’n her
fainty fit all right, and they have put her to sleep comfortable,”
replied the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir, that is all I have to tell you; and now, as I
may be missed, I think I had better hurry back,” said
Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait; here is a letter I wish you to take to your mistress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Another one, sir?” inquired the boy, distrustfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but <i>this</i> letter is to prepare her for the receipt of
the packet. I wish you to give her <i>this</i> letter <i>first</i>. And
after she has read it, hand her the packet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And here is your reward,” said Mr. Hammond, putting
a piece of gold in the boy’s hand.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>“If you please, sir, I don’t like to take any pay for serving
of her,” said Leo, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense! Take it for serving me, then,” laughed
Dick, forcing the money upon the youth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo pocketed the fee, and hurried home.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was quite dark when he reached the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>All that night mammy sat up and watched by the bedside
of her charge. Drusilla slept soundly and late.</p>

<p class='c011'>All dreaded her awakening. But to the surprise and
relief of her attendants, she awoke quite calmly; though
whether her quietude was the lethargy produced by the continued
influence of the morphine, or whether it was the
apathy of despair, it was hard to tell. She permitted the
nurse to bathe her face and hands, and to smoothe her hair.
She partook slightly of the light breakfast that was brought
her. But beyond these she scarcely moved, looked or spoke.
After an hour or two she intimated that she would rise; and,
with the assistance of her nurse, she got up, dressed herself,
and went to her easy chair. And there she sat, pale, mute,
and still as death.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mammy,” whispered Pina, “speak to her—make her
talk. Indeed it scares me all but to death to see her that
away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush,” muttered the nurse, “let her alone. ‘It’s ill
waking sleeping dogs’—which I mean to say, long as she’s
quiet be thankful for it, and don’t ’sturb her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I’d rather see her cry, and scream, and rave, than
see her so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s because you’s a fool; for I hadn’t, and that’s a
fact, in her sitivation, too! Go ’long gal; what you
know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, Leo watched for an opportunity to execute the
commission entrusted to him. He did not find one until
the afternoon, when mammy and Pina being seated at their
early dinner, sent Leo with an armful of wood up to the
lady’s chamber to replenish the fire.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>When the boy had done that duty, swept up the hearth,
and replaced the shovel and tongs, he turned to where his
mistress sat, in her chair, pale, silent, and motionless as a
statue, and he drew the letter from his pocket, and offered
her, saying, respectfully:</p>

<p class='c011'>“From the gentleman who was here yesterday, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla mechanically took the letter, and stared blankly
at the boy for a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where did you get this?” she inquired, as she broke
the seal; and her voice sounded strangely to her attendant
as she asked the question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“From the gentleman who was here yesterday, ma’am,
as I said,” repeated Leo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he here to-day?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When then did you get this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yesterday, ma’am, before he left the neighborhood,”
answered the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla read the letter. It was directed very formally
to Mrs. Alexander Lyon, Cedarwood Cottage. It ran thus:</p>

<div class='c016'><span class='sc'>Drovers’ Rest</span>, Tuesday Evening.</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>My Dearest Lady.</span>—As the executioner, kneeling, begs
pardon of the victim he is about to slay, so humbly at your
feet I would implore forgiveness for the blow I am fated to
strike you, as well as for all the pain I have already been
forced to give you. But after having stated some strange
facts to you, I feel bound to prove the truth of my statement.
The bearer of this will also deliver to you certain
papers, to which I beg leave to call your particular attention.
Your own pure spirit will teach you how to act in
the premises. And now, my dear Mrs. Lyon, I can not
close this letter without entreating you to remember, and to
take comfort in the remembrance, that in this great trial of
yours you are only the sufferer, not the sinner; that in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>judgment of all good and honorable people you will be held
blameless. And as for myself, here in all honesty of purpose,
as in the sight of Heaven, I offer you my utmost services.
All that a brother might do for a beloved sister, or a
father for an idolized daughter in her distress, I will do for
you. I and all I possess shall be at your commands; and
my business and my pleasure shall at any time give way to
your requirements of me. A letter directed to me at the
general post-office, Washington, will always find me, where-ever
I may be, and always as Your respectful friend,</p>

<div class='c016'><span class='sc'>Richard Hammond</span>.</div>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla read this letter, and with a sigh, but without a
syllable, she laid it aside, and held out her hand to Leo,
saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give me the other papers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy drew from his pocket the large, yellow envelope,
and delivered it to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She opened it and emptied out its contents. The first
that caught her eye was a newspaper with a marked passage
in it. She took it up. It was the <cite>Valley Courier</cite>, a little
local journal published in the county town near the county-seat
of General Lyon. And the marked passage was as
follows:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Marriage in High Life.</span>—We understand that Alexander
Lyon, Esq., of Crow Wood, only son and heir of the late eminent
Chief Justice of that name, is about to lead to the hymeneal altar
his cousin, the beautiful and accomplished Anna, the grand-daughter
and sole heiress of the veteran General Lyon, of old Lyon
Hall and of Revolutionary celebrity. The engagement has been of
long standing, the nuptials having been twice arrested by the hand
of death. Now however, we are happy to learn that, both at Crow
Wood, the seat of the bridegroom, and at Old Lyon Hall, the
home of the bride, the most splendid preparations are on foot in
honor of the joyful occasion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla read this article and, without a word of comment,
a movement of feature, or a change of color, she put it
down and took up a letter with a broken seal. She unfolded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>and read it. It was from General Lyon to Richard
Hammond.</p>

<div class='c016'><span class='sc'>Old Lyon Hall</span>, Nov. 1, 18—.</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>My Dear Dick</span>:—Alick and Anna are to be married
on Thursday, the fifteenth instant. And now, my dear boy,
I wish you, with your accustomed frankness and good
humor, to “let by-gones be by-gones,” and to come down
and be present at the wedding. I know it will be painful
to you; but brave men do not shrink from pain. And,
Dick, you know that there are but four of us left out of all
the old stock—Dick, Alick, Anna and me. I have long
passed the threescore and ten years allotted as the natural
term of a man’s life, and so may daily look for my summons
hence. Dick, Alick and Anna seem to me as my own
children. Dick, you have never in your life pleased me
with one single sight of your face at Old Lyon Hall. I
know why you have kept away, my boy. But now I trust
you will conquer your reluctance and come, rather than
grieve the soul of Your loving uncle,</p>

<div class='c016'><span class='sc'>Leonard Lyon</span>.</div>

<p class='c011'>Still without a syllable of complaint, or a variation of
complexion, she let this letter flutter down from her hand,
and she raised the sole remaining one.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was a sealed envelope, directed to herself. She
broke the seal and found an old and closely written communication
from General Lyon to Richard Hammond, which
it is unnecessary to give here at length. It was very
necessary, however, for Drusilla’s knowledge of the whole
truth that she should read every line of it. So at least
thought Dick, and therefore he had sent it to her with the
others, but <i>sealed</i>, lest other eyes should see its meaning.
In this letter General Lyon spoke of the long season in
Washington during which himself, Alick, Anna and Dick
were always together. And thus Drusilla, for the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>time, learned the true nature of that “business connected
with his late father’s will” which had taken Alexander
daily and nightly from her side. And now she discovered
the double-dealing and the deep dishonor of the man she
called her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>She dropped this last letter, and it fell at her feet. Her
face turned no paler, because in fact it was already as pale
as it could possibly be, and had not a vestige of color to
lose.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had already suffered so much, so much that it seemed
impossible for her to suffer more. Blow after blow had
fallen with cruel weight upon her young heart, until it
seemed benumbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides, what had she learned now worse than that
which she had known and wept for many days—his
treachery to her? Only through the numbness of her
heart and the dullness of her head, one feeling and one
thought clearly and strongly moved—that his marriage
with Miss Lyon must be arrested and he himself saved
from this last culmination of his criminal career.</p>

<p class='c011'>The extremity of sorrow, when it does not destroy life or
reason, always strengthens the character. Such must have
been its effect upon Drusilla to enable her to rise above her
misery and her weakness, with the fixed determination to
go in person to Old Lyon Hall, for the purpose of preventing
that “<span class='sc'>Marriage in High Life</span>” which the <i>Valley
Courier</i> had announced to the world with such a grand
flourish of editorial trumpets.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Having finished reading all the letters and papers that
had been submitted to her examination, in proof of the perfidy
of her husband, Drusilla sat on, for a few moments,
pale, still, and mute. She would not weep now—the fountain
of her tears was dry at last. She could scarcely feel—her
heart was stunned almost to insensibility.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now she knew the very worst. Now she could not doubt
that her husband had deserted her and that he meditated
the crime of marriage with his cousin Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, the crime!</p>

<p class='c011'>For, notwithstanding all that Richard Hammond had
said and thought to the contrary, she knew that she herself
not only ought to have been, in right—but really was, in
fact—the true wife of Alexander Lyon; and that it was
but a slight legal informality, unsuspected by her and even
by him at the time of their marriage, of which he was now
about to avail himself in breaking the sacred bonds that
bound him to his young wife, in order to unite himself to
his wealthy cousin. She knew that this intended act would
be a sin, and she feared that it might be construed into a
felony. There was an ugly word in the dictionary called
“bigamy,” and its penalty was uglier still—the state’s
prison. To save Alexander in his moral insanity, from
such guilt and such degradation, she resolved to go to Old
Lyon Hall and stop the intended marriage, even though
the adventure should cost her her life.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>“And the wedding is to be celebrated on the evening of
the fifteenth, and this is the morning of the fourteenth, and
I have but little more than twenty-four hours to do all that
must be done to save him!” she said, speaking her mind
aloud, to the infinite surprise and alarm of Leo, who was
still standing before her and who now looked as if he
thought his mistress had gone crazy,—and “well she
might,” he said to himself, as he gazed on her where she
sat with her hands clasped to her temples.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla reflected intently for a few moments. There
were several ways of reaching Old Lyon Hall,—one was to
go by steamer down the Potomac to Chesapeake Bay and up
James River to the Stormy Petrel landing, and then by
turnpike to the Porcupine Mountain; another was to take
the railway train from Alexandria to Richmond, and then
the stage-coach across the country. Both these routes were
favored by the Lyon family when they had leisure and were
travelling for recreation. But both required two days of
travel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla saw that she must take the third, which was the
shortest if the roughest route—the old line of stagecoaches
running between Washington city and Western
Virginia. It is true this road was very dangerous, especially
at night. It crossed the Blue Ridge, the Shenandoah,
and the Alleghany mountains. It wound around terrible
heights where there were many hundred feet of perpendicular
rock above and below, with little width of way between.
Once in a while you heard of a coach being crushed by the
fall of the rocks from above, or dashed to pieces by going
over the side of the precipice. Upon the whole this was
not a favored route with travellers who could avoid it. But
Drusilla resolved to take it because it was the shortest to
her place of destination, and in less than twenty-four hours
it would take her to a little mountain hamlet within ten
miles of Old Lyon Hall. True, she might meet with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>accident on the road, but if she should lose her life she
might serve Alick by that means as well or better than by
preventing his marriage with Anna, since if she (Drusilla)
were dead, that marriage would be no longer criminal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leo,” she inquired, looking up at the anxious boy,
“what is the hour?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo glanced at the ormolu clock on the mantle-piece, and
answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is nearly one, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know what time the night coach for Western
Virginia leaves Washington?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know what time it leaves Washington, ma’am,
but it passes through Alexandry at five.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then it must start at about three or half-past. Leo!
hurry down stairs; tell your mother and Pina to come to
me immediately. Then go to the stable and put the horses
to the carriage, and prepare yourself to drive me to town,
and be as quick as you possibly can; do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am,” answered the amazed boy, making his
awkward bow, and going on his errand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, with a marvellous new life in her system, arose
and went to her bureau drawers and began hastily to select
certain indispensable conveniences for her journey, and to
pack them into a travelling bag.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! at that moment, and under those circumstances
what painful feelings that pretty Turkey morocco bag awakened;
for “sorrow’s crown of sorrow is the memory of happier
days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bag had been given to her first, by old Mrs. Lyon,
when that lady had hoped to take her favorite down to old
Lyon Hall to the wedding of Alick and Anna. And well
Drusilla remembered how much she was pleased with the
gift that combined beauty with utility; how much she
admired its construction, with its various pockets and
recesses for the reception of all sorts of travelling necessaries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>But she never went down to that wedding, which
never took place, as you already know.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next, nearly two years afterward, she had packed this
very bag for her journey to meet Alick and to be married to
him, herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now she was packing it to go and prevent his marriage
with his cousin. Truly, the little bag was associated
with weddings for good or ill.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Drusilla was stowing away combs, brushes, soap,
cologne, napkins, handkerchiefs, chamber-slippers, etc., into
her travelling bag, and reflecting on all its happy and unhappy
associations, she was interrupted by the hasty entrance
of Pina and Pina’s mammy, both with their eyes
wide open in astonishment; for Leo had startled them both
with the announcement that his mistress had ordered the
carriage quite suddenly to go the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, ma’am, what is all this, to be sure?”
inquired “mammy,” with the authority, not to say the
insolence, belonging even to the best of her sisterhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is what, nurse?” questioned Drusilla, with calm
dignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That boy—which I believe he’s lying, and if he is I
will chastise him well for it—says how you has ordered the
carriage to go to Washington immediate; which I know,
ma’am, you would never think of doing nothing so unprudent;
and I’ll give it to Leo well for scaring of me with
his lies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leo has told you no falsehood. I have ordered the
carriage to take me to the city,” said Drusilla, calmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, ma’am, I hope you’ll follow my ’vice and think
better of it, and do no such undiscreet thing,” said mammy,
grimly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no choice, nurse. This is not with me a matter
of will, but of necessity. I must go to Washington to take
the night coach for Western Virginia.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>At this announcement, mammy stared for a moment in
speechless consternation. Then lifting both her hands, she
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“To take the night coach for Wes’ Wirginy! Well,
Lord! And is you crazy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not crazy; though I know how strange my purpose
must seem to you,” answered Drusilla, quietly, as she folded
some white linen collars, and placed them in her bag.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And <span class='fss'>DOES</span> you know the dangers?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of the road? Well, I recollect that there was a coach
upset on the Hogback Mountain, and nine passengers killed
or wounded, only last spring.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t mean the road, though that’s as bad as bad can
be, to my sartain knowledge, which has travelled of it once.
I mean your siteration, there! do you know the dangers of
<i>that</i>, a bumping and a thumping, and a tumbling and a
rumbling over them rocky roads? I say, do you know the
dangers of <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I don’t, nurse; I only know that whatever they are,
I must face them,” said Drusilla, so calmly and so firmly,
that the old woman knew at once that it would be utterly
vain to try to turn her from her purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, for goodness sake, <i>why</i> must you go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“From imminent necessity, nurse, that I can’t stop now
to explain. I wish you to be kind enough to pack up under
clothing and other necessaries enough to last me a week.
Pina, empty the little red trunk and bring it here to
nurse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, for patience’s sake, whar is you going, child?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going to see my husband.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are going to your death!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps. If so, I shall serve him just as well,” murmured
Drusilla, in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, child, tell me, what’s the great ’cessity? What
for must you go to see your husband sich a long distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>over sich roads in your siteration, and to the rist of your
life?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is—in imminent danger,” said Drusilla, evasively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor! and that was the bad news as that gentleman
brought you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And it overcomed you so! Well, Lord! to think of
the tender heart! But what is the matter of him, honey?—pleurisy,
I shouldn’t wonder! That’s most in general
what ails people this time of the year. Is it pleurisy,
honey?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not that; but do not stop now to ask questions. I
have no time to answer them. Here is Pina with the
trunk. And here are my keys. Go to my wardrobes and
bureaus, and select what is needful for my journey. And
pray be quick about it, for I have no time to lose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, but honey, hear me for one minute first. It may
be that he is very ill, but he may get over it, ’out your
gwine to see him. Yes, and if you go, he may get well and
you may die. And anyway, I don’t see the use of two lives
and maybe three lives risted instead of one. Take my ’vice,
honey, and stay quietly at home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse, listen. I should suffer a thousand times more
in <i>mind</i> to stay here, than I possibly could to go the journey
that I have fully resolved to take,” said Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, honey, in either case your life must be risted, I
suppose; and of course you have got a right to take your
choice <i>how</i> it shall be risted. So now, all I got to do is to
make your journey as comfor’ble as I can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. That is indeed all that you can do,” said
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But mind, honey, <i>I gwine long with you</i>,” said mammy,
with grim resolution.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You? You going, nurse? I have not asked you!”
exclaimed Drusilla, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>“No, honey, you haven’t axed me; which I believe you
never even thought of so doing. But if you must travel—by
night, too—surely you’d never think of travelling alone
in your state of health.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is true—I never thought of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which it seems to me you never do think of yourself,
honey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it is a hard journey for you to undertake. Would
not Pina do as well to go with me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hi, honey, what good Pina going to be, case you taken
ill on the road? No, child, long as you <i>will</i> go, you must
consent to take the ole ’oman along to look after you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe you are right; quite right; and I thank you
very much. But now you must let Pina pack that little
trunk for me, while you go and get ready to attend me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And be very quick, nurse. See, it is half-past one. It
will take us an hour to ride to Washington, and I wish to
be there by three o’clock, so as to make sure of the coach.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, ma’am. I will be ready in half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the old woman hurried away, not ill pleased to vary
the monotony of her life at Cedarwood by a journey, this
fine weather, into the mountainous regions of Virginia. It
is true that this was a measure she would not have recommended
to her patient; but, since that lady was resolved
upon it, “mammy” made the best of it, and determined to
draw what good she might out of the change of scene and
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>In just ten minutes mammy returned to the room, dressed
for her journey, and equipped with a carpet bag that contained
all her travelling belongings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have been very quick,” said Drusilla, approvingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, honey; which it is my pride and ambition always
so to be. I had half an hour; that’s thirty minutes—three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>times ten. The first ten minutes I gives to getting myself
ready. Now, the next ten minutes I gives to something
else,” said mammy, speaking hastily, and, <i>while</i> speaking,
drawing from a closet a small red morocco trunk, which she
proceeded to pack with a full supply of body linen and all
the necessaries of a baby’s first toilet, setting the baby’s
basket in the tray in the top of the trunk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is all that for?” inquired Drusilla, who was
busy hooking up her travelling dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never you mind, honey. You go on a fixing of yourself,
and leave me alone. And there, the second ten
minutes is up!” said the old woman, as she fastened down
and locked the trunk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what is that for?” persisted Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’, honey, does you forget? There’s three of us
going this journey. And that trunk is for the third one.
And now I have got only the last ten minutes left, and I
must give that to something else still,” said mammy, as she
flew down stairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Drusilla, while putting on her cloak, bonnet
and gloves, gave Pina many charges about the care of the
house, the birds, the dogs, and all the pets of the establishment,
which would be in her charge during the absence of
the mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Pina promised the utmost fidelity; but begged her
lady to order Leo to sleep in the house, because she, Pina,
would be afraid to sleep there alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla had but just promised this, when “mammy” reappeared
with a large and well-filled luncheon basket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How thoughtful you are. And how thankful I ought
to be that I have you to think for me and to take care of
me at this crisis,” said Drusilla, with feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor, honey, what’s the use of my having lived fifty
year in this world if I <i>aint</i> thoughtful? And what call
you to be thankful to me, for doing of that which it is my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>bounden duty to do, seeing I’m paid for it?” replied
mammy, laughing, for her spirits were rising with the excitement
of the journey before her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, nurse, there are some services that cannot be purchased
or paid for, and yours are of that sort.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a bit, honey. And now the time is up and we’s
all ready. And here’s everything you can possibly want.
And Leo, he told me to tell you as the carriage was waiting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you; we will go then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, honey.——And, now, Pina, you be good gal and
take care of the house while your missus is gone,” said
the nurse, turning to her daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, mammy. When will missus be home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When you sees her, you fool; and not a minute sooner.
And mind you have everything ready for her when she
comes; fire made in her room and all; mind that, or it
will be the worse for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, mammy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla gave a last glance around the room, so full of
pleasing and painful memories—the room which she felt she
might never see again; and then, silently commending herself
to Providence, she left it and led the way down stairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The carriage stood ready; the luggage was piled on
behind. Leo had the door open and the steps down. Drusilla
entered, followed by her nurse. Both took a kind last
leave of Pina, who thrust her head and hands in at the
window for the purpose. And Leo cracked his whip and
started his horses.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>A few minutes after three o’clock, the carriage containing
Drusilla and her attendant stopped before the office of
the Washington and Western Virginia line of stage
coaches.</p>

<p class='c011'>In great anxiety, Drusilla drew up the carriage curtain
and looked out of the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no sign of a coach near the office.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is gone, it is gone,” she cried, clasping her hands in
despair. “It is gone and I know I can never reach the
place in time to save him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now don’t you take on so, ma’am, that’s a dear child.
The coach mayn’t have come yet, much less gone,” said
mammy, soothingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the porters about the office had come forward
and commenced unstrapping the baggage from behind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo jumped off his seat and came and opened the carriage
door and let down the steps.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it any use to alight, Leo? Is not the coach gone?”
sighed the lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’, no, ma’am—it haven’t gone out of the stable yet.
We’ve lots of time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank heaven!” exclaimed Drusilla, in a tone of
great relief.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy gathered up her carpet bag, umbrella and big
shawl—all carried for her mistress’s accommodation and
not for her own—and prepared to alight.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>“Here, boy, you let me get out first, so I can help the
madam,” she said, handing a part of her paraphernalia to
her son, and then clumsily but safely tumbling herself
down to the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take care, mammy,” said the boy, when all the danger
was over.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, that job’s done! I’m allus thankful when I can
get out’n a carriage without hurting of myself or breaking
anything. And now, honey, let me help <i>you</i> out. Be
careful, child,” she said, holding her arms forth to receive
her charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stand aside, please,” smiled Drusilla; and then, rather
than avail herself of mammy’s dangerous assistance, she
alighted without aid, and immediately entered the office,
calling Leo to attend her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seeing a lady’s waiting-room back of the office, she gave
her purse to Leo, telling him to go to the clerk and secure
their seats; but then, as the sudden thought that they
might all be already taken flashed into her mind, she
hurried after the boy up to the clerk’s desk and eagerly
inquired:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you any seats left in the coach now about to
start?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Miss; lots. We have nine inside, and only one
taken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I will take two at once,” said Drusilla, with
another sigh of relieved anxiety.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Four, master, if you please; we’ll take four. <i>All</i> the
back seats and one of the others,” said mammy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is that for?” hastily whispered Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Cause, child, you can’t sit up all night. You must lie
down, and you must have all the back seats to lie on like a
sofy, you know,” whispered mammy, in reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How many seats will you take, Miss?” inquired the
clerk, who had looked on, pen in hand, while this low-toned
consultation was going forward.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>“Four,” answered Drusilla. “And my servant here will
settle for them. Come, nurse, leave Leo to finish this
business, and attend me to the ladies’ room.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, honey, in one minute. I just want to stop here
and see the <i>back</i> seats secured all for you, all together, to
lie down on. ’Twould be no use for you to have three
seats ’stributed all about the coach, for how could you ’cline
on them? Leave me to ’range for you, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, nurse, do as you think best,” said Drusilla,
passing on to the back room.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a side window, opening upon an alley leading
to the stables where the coaches were kept.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla perceived this, and seated herself by the window
to watch for the coming of the night coach. She was in
such a state of feverish anxiety, that she could not rest.
True, two great causes of uneasiness were removed. She
was in time for the coach, and she could get seats enough;
but still, in her eager impatience, she could not be at peace,
and she longed to be on her journey, to feel herself whirled
swiftly onward towards the place she was so ardently desirous
to reach.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently she was joined by mammy, who dropped her
fat self down upon a chair, making it creak under her
weight, and said, triumphantly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, honey, it’s all right, and you’ll travel as easy as
if you was a lying on your own sofy! I left that boy Leo
to watch the luggidge.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m very much obliged to you; but at the same time,
if the coach should be full, and any one should want two
of my places, they must have them,” said Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Must they? What’s the use o’ our paying for them, if
it wasn’t to keep out all ’truders that <i>did</i> come? If the
coach wasn’t <i>going</i> to be full, we needn’t a paid for no extra
seats, seeing as we might a had ’em for nothing, ma’am.
And don’t you think so much of other people. Think a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>little more of yourself, ma’am. Take a <i>little</i> bit of pity on
yourself, which you never does, though the Lord knows you
needs it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy’s discourse was interrupted by music as delightful
to the eager ears of Drusilla as the sublimest strains of
Handel—the rumbling of the stage-coach as it rolled out of
the stable yard, and whirled around the corner and drew up
before the office door.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla was on her feet in an instant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now don’t be in such a hurry, ma’am. You be quiet.
Bless you, it will be some time yet before it starts.
They’ve got all the luggidge to put up yet. Leo, he’ll call
us when it’s time to get in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a sigh Drusilla dropped into her seat. Moments
seemed hours, and hours months to her, until she could
reach old Lyon Hall and prevent the consummation of her
Alick’s meditated crime.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length the long wished for signal came. Leo looked
into the room, touched his hat, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Coach ready, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla arose in haste and excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leo loaded himself with the light luggage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy drew her big blanket shawl about her, and so
they went out of the office.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leo, my good boy, take great care of yourself and your
sister, and of the house and the animals, while I am gone,”
said the lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am; you may trust me for that,” answered the
boy, very earnestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Leo, mind, go to the office every day; and if you
find letters for me, put them in the directed and stamped
envelopes I gave you, and post them with your own hand—do
you hear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am, and will be sure to remember,” said Leo,
almost weeping.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>She shook hands with her servant, and sent her love by
him to Pina, and bade him good-bye.</p>

<p class='c011'>In another moment Drusilla and her attendant were in
the coach—the only passengers there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla sat reclining in the corner of the back seat, but
mammy, who had not yet seated herself, was fussing about,
stowing away such portable luggage as they had brought
in their hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, honey!” she said, as she placed a carpet bag in
the other corner of the seat, where her lady sat, and spread
a soft shawl doubled over it, “there, that will be a tolerable
pillow for you when you want to lay down. And here’s
another shawl that’ll do to spread over you. And I reckon
I might’s well take the lunching basket and umberella on to
the seat with me. And, dear knows, it looks as if we was
agoing to have all the coach to ourselves, any way; so we
had no call to pay for so many seats we might a had for
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>While mammy rambled on in this manner, apparently
for no other purpose than the pleasure of hearing the sound
of her own voice, Drusilla sat gazing out of the window at
her own pretty little carriage, with her faithful boy perched
upon the coachman’s seat. Poor Leo was waiting to see
his beloved mistress off before leaving the spot.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now let me see—whar shall I put this ’ere bundle
so I won’t forget it? And here, ma’am, you better take
this purty little reticule o’ yours in with you, ’cause——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse,” said Drusilla, drawing in her head, “you had
better sit down and be still. The coach is about to start.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am, so I will, soon’s ever I find a convenient
place for these gum shoes in case we have to get out in the
wet, ’cause you see, honey—”</p>

<p class='c011'>The sudden starting of the coach stopped mammy’s oration
short by jerking her forward upon her hands and knees.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’ a massy upon me! This is a pretty beginning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>isn’t it now? if it’s all agoing to be like this!” grumbled
mammy, as she gathered herself up, and reeled to and fro
with the swinging action of the coach before she could
recover her equilibrium and take her seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, who was looking out of the window, and waving
her hand in a last adieu to her poor devoted servant, did
not perceive mammy’s summersault or her complaints.</p>

<p class='c011'>The coach swung on at a fearful rate until it reached
Fourteenth street, where it stopped at the great hotel there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I s’pects here’s where they’re gwine to pick up the other
passenger, which sorry enough am I for it as anybody else
should be intruding upon us,” said mammy, folding her
arms and sitting up as if she had been in her own private
equipage.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Drusilla lay back in her corner, not even caring
enough about her unknown fellow-passenger to turn her
eyes towards the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c011'>A tall young man, wrapped in a dark cloak, with its
collar turned up around his face, and wearing a cap pulled
low over his brow, came out of the hotel, followed by a
porter with some luggage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The luggage was put into the boot behind. The young
man climbed up on top.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, a outside passenger, after all, thank goodness,”
said mammy, reposing herself cautiously back upon the
cushions to avoid another jar as the horses started.</p>

<p class='c011'>The coach thundered down Fourteenth street south, and
onward until it reached the foot of the Long Bridge, where
it slackened speed, as “the law directs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah, Heaven! what pleasing, painful memories were
awakened in the poor child’s mind and heart by the sight
of this old bridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon just such a day and hour as this she had crossed it
for the first time. Then as now, the gorgeous crimson rays
of the afternoon sun blazed down upon the river, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>wintry wooded shores were reflected in deep shadows along
the reddened waters. Then as now, the scene was transfigured
by the hour into supernal beauty and glory.</p>

<p class='c011'>But <i>then</i> she was a newly made and blessed bride,
seated by her husband’s side and going to share his home
and bless his life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scarcely eleven months had passed, and now, now she
was recrossing the same river, gazing on the same scene, at
the same hour,—a deserted wife though an expectant
mother—a nearly heart-broken woman because an accusing
spirit, going to confront her husband, and confound his
criminal plans. And at this hour on the morrow, where
should she be? At Old Lyon Hall, bringing exposure and
shame upon her guilty but still dear Alick—bringing mortification
and sorrow to his expectant young bride—spreading
consternation and gloom among the gay wedding
guests. Could she bear to do this? But perhaps at this
hour to-morrow she might be dead and “past her pain,”
for who could say whether she would have strength to live
through the terrors of the scene she was so resolved to
brave?</p>

<p class='c011'>Her mournful reverie was interrupted by mammy. The
slow motion of the coach was favorable to conversation, and
mammy loved to let her tongue run.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see that sunset, don’t you, ma’am?” asked the old
woman, pointing to where the sun was slowly sinking
behind some long black clouds that lay along the summits
of the western hills.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I see them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That means bad weather, ma’am. All the good Indy
summer goes down with that sun, ma’am. You may take
my ’sperience for that. We gwine to have rain and wind,
and may be snow and sleet. For my part I pray to the
Lord as we may reach our journey’s end before it comes too
severe. When does you expect to get there, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>“Some time to-morrow afternoon or evening; I do not
exactly know the hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The coach reached the western terminus of the bridge,
passed quietly through it, and then rapidly increasing its
speed, thundered onward over the rough old turnpike road.</p>

<p class='c011'>Trees, houses, farms, forests flew past as the coach
whirled onward up hill and down dale, until it reached
Alexandria.</p>

<p class='c011'>It drew up in the midst of the old town, before its office,
took the address of the single passenger for whom it was
directed to call, changed horses for a fresh start, and swung
around into Duke street.</p>

<p class='c011'>What was it here that suddenly aroused Drusilla from
her painful absorption in her own troubled thoughts?</p>

<p class='c011'>The coach drew up before the house in which she had
been married!</p>

<p class='c011'>She let down her veil, and, growing rapidly red and pale
with excitement, looked out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon the door opened, and the young minister—the very
one who had performed her marriage ceremony—came out,
carpet bag in hand, and shawl over his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see I am quite punctual,” he said, speaking to the
gentleman passenger on top.</p>

<p class='c011'>The other did not reply, but probably made a sign, for
the minister nodded pleasantly, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. I am coming up there to sit by you. Besides,
the night is so fine it would be a pity to box one’s self up
inside.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And with this the reverend traveller climbed to his
place, and the coach started.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla sat back in her corner and drew aside her veil.
Then she saw at the same moment mammy draw her head
in from the other window and raise her eyes with a look of
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if that don’t beat Injuns!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>“What, nurse?” inquired Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, honey, that gentleman as has just got up on top,
is the Reberend Mr. Hopper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have known him, then,” said Drusilla, with awakened
interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hi, honey, why wouldn’t I know my own pastors and
masters and sponsors in baptism? Sure I does know him,
good too. Didn’t I sit underneaf of his preaching ebber
since here he’s been till I come to lib long o’ you? What
you talking ’bout, honey? I knows him good as I do my
own chillun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he an Alexandria man?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh lor, no, honey, not he! He comes from the northud
and hasn’t been in these here parts moren’ a year; no, nor
come to think of it, that long, nyther; ’cause I ’members
well, he come the first of last Janivary as ebber was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then,” thought Drusilla to herself, “he could not have
been but a few days in the State before he married Alick
and me.” And speaking aloud, she asked—“What did
you say his name was, nurse? I have forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hopper, child! Mr. Hopper, honey; the Reberent
Mr. Hopper; which whoever heard tell of a reberent gentleman
of the name o’ Hopper, which to my thinking is
more besuited a dancing-master, or a skipping-jack nor a
Methody minis’er. But so it is, honey; and I ’spose
people aint to be blamed for their misfortnit names. But
what <i>I</i> would like to know is, what he gwine prowlywowling
’bout the country for?” said mammy.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla shared her curiosity, though she did not
answer it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, indeed, could be taking this young Methodist
minister, who had married her to Alick, and who could
testify to the validity of the marriage? What <i>could</i> be
taking him on the same day, by the same conveyance, on
the same journey with herself? Could his errand have any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>connection with Alick’s approaching iniquitous marriage, or
with his prior one? Indeed it looked so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, nonsense, I am morbid and fanciful; the minister
who married us happens to be journeying at the same time
and in the same coach with myself, and I jump to the conclusion
that he is going to the like place on the like business.
What a weak fool my sorrows have made me, to be
sure,” said Drusilla to herself, taking her imagination to
task for its vagaries.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she could not quite stop its wanderings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell you what, honey, the night is a going to be a
bad one. Them clouds over there is a banking up like
mountains of soot. And the most <i>I</i> care for is this:—it
will drive them there passengers from the top to the inside,
to moilest us,” said mammy, drawing her head in from the
window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, they have a right to come, nurse. You would
not keep them out in the rain all night, would you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; that I would; ’cause I want to have the coach all
to ourselves,” said mammy, positively.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was quite dark and very cloudy when the coach
reached the little, rural town of Drainsville, where the
horses were to be changed and the passengers were to take
tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, honey; les us get out,” said mammy, hiding
away some of her treasures, while she loaded herself with
others.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I would rather stay here, nurse,” said Drusilla,
languidly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, no,” objected mammy, authoritatively, “not at
all. I can’t allow it. The coach will be here for a good
half an hour. You get out, and come in the house, and
walk about a little to stretch your limbs; and take off your
bonnet to ease your head, and have your tea comfortable.
It will freshen you up a heap for the rest of the journey.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>“And the goodness gracious alive knows as you <i>need</i> freshening
up, and you won’t get another chance till the stage
stops at Frostville to breakfast. And that will be a good
twelve hour long. Think of that, now, and do as I ’vises
of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Before mammy was half through her exordium, Drusilla,
convinced by her eloquence, had risen to her feet, and was
drawing her cloak around her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She saw through the darkness her fellow-travellers from
the top get off and go into the bar-room of the neat and
comfortable inn. And she gave her hand to the guard,
who kindly came around to help her to alight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, Miss, there is the private door—a nice place,
Miss, with a nice landlady and a good table; shall I take
you in, Miss?” he inquired, hoisting a large umbrella, for
it was now beginning to rain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks, yes,” returned Drusilla, “the ground seems
slippery.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This way, if you please, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bad manners to your imperence, this lady is a married
lady, and not a young Miss,” said mammy, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beg pardon; but I thought the madam <i>looked</i> young,”
said the guard, laughing, yet not disrespectfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>He took her safely across the slippery way, and showed
her into a neat, well warmed and lighted parlor, where the
table was cleanly set for tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>The landlady, a cheerful, hospitable looking person, as a
landlady should be, came to meet her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you like to go to a bedroom, ma’am?” inquired
the smiling hostess, who was led into no mistake by the
child face of her guest, because her quick and experienced
eye had discovered the truth at a glance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, please,” answered Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>And preceded by the landlady and followed by the nurse,
she was taken up stairs to a large bed room, whose red
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>carpet, white walls and draperies, and bright fire, gave it a
very pleasant aspect.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla sauntered about, enjoying the privilege of locomotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll have tea, I suppose, ma’am?” inquired the
hostess.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, please; and I will have it here,” answered Drusilla,
as she took off her bonnet and laid it on the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>The landlady left the room to issue orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>While waiting for her tea, Drusilla washed her face and
took down her hair and combed it out, and then did it up
loosely in a net, so that she would be able to lie down and
sleep with it so. Then she made the fastenings of her
clothing easy.</p>

<p class='c011'>And by the time she had finished preparing her toilet for
the night journey, a maid-servant appeared with a tablecloth
and tea tray.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla drank two cups of tea, for she was feverishly
thirsty. And then, being scolded into the measure by
mammy, who assured her that two lives depended on her
feeding, she ate a buttered muffin, and the breast of a
boiled chicken with cream sauce.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, in the child-like simplicity of her heart, would
have made her nurse sit down to the table and partake her
supper.</p>

<p class='c011'>But mammy asserted that she—Aunt Hector—knew her
place. And so she filled the slop bowl brimming full of
tea, piled up a plate with three quarters of the chicken and
half a dozen muffins, went off to a distant corner of the
room, seated herself upon an old chest, ranged her supper
around her, and, with a promptness and dispatch that made
her mistress stare, she dispatched all these edibles, and announced
herself in condition to pursue her journey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now if the coach is ready, I is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But if mammy and the coach were both ready, the passengers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>at the tea-table down stairs were not; but the
coach was not so very strictly confined to time, and so it
was a good quarter of an hour longer, and Drusilla had
ample leisure to put on her bonnet, and to pay her bill,
before she and her attendant were summoned to take their
places.</p>

<p class='c011'>The guard kindly and carefully assisted the delicate
young matron into her corner of the back seat, saying that
he would warn the other passengers who were coming in for
the night that the whole of it belonged to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She thanked him, and then called to her nurse to make
haste and enter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, honey, yes; I’m coming just as soon’s ever I
catch my eyes on them two little red morocky trunks, which
I haven’t seen ’em since we left Alexandry,” said mammy,
who was behind the coach, engaged in a sharp argument
with both coachman and hostler.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you, woman,” said the former, “the blamed red
trunks is all right. They is inside of the boot, kivered
over with the ile skin to keep out the wet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, so you say; but I’d a heap rather see ’em with my
own two looking eyes. And believe you I won’t till I
does,” snapped mammy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There then, blast you, look for yourself,” said the
hostler, pulling apart the leathern flaps of the boot.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy peeped through the aperture, and seeing the
treasure safe, she smiled and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank ye, sir. Sorry to give you trouble; but seeing
is believing, and nothing short of it aint.—Yes, honey;
yes, honey, I’m coming now!” she exclaimed, in answer to
her lady’s repeated summonses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy tumbled up into the coach with even more than
her usual blundering awkwardness; for it was as dark as
Tophet, and the guard did not seem to consider it necessary
to hold a light to such a refractory passenger. And so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>mammy, after fumbling blindly about to find the seat she
had formerly occupied, turned and dropped herself heavily
down upon a gentleman’s lap. A simultaneous—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c011'>A cry of pain from the victim and of surprise from the
oppressor arose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beg pardon, sir, I’m sure; but I’m a heavy ole ’oman,
and you shouldn’t a hit up agin me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hit up agin you! Oh!” exclaimed the injured party,
in a tragi-comic groan.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the sound of his voice Drusilla started violently, and
lowered her veil; though in fact it was too dark either to
see or to be seen; for oh! with what a thrill of vague
dread she recognized Dick Hammond’s tones, although she
could not discern his face!</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish you wouldn’t yowl out in that onyearthly way,
sir; you’ll disturb a deliky lady I has in my charge,”
expostulated mammy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll roar you softly an’ it were a sucking dove, and
bear my tortures with the patience of a slaughtered lamb,”
laughed Dick, in a lachrymose manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope it aint as bad as all that, sir. Take a sup o’
brandy out of my bottle,” said mammy, feeling about all
the vacant seats with her big hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this instant the coach started so suddenly with such a
violent lurch, that mammy was jerked back, and precipitated
upon the knees of the unlucky Dick. And in
scrambling upon her feet she laid hold of his hair to help
herself up by.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Outch!” screeched the victim. “She’s finished me
now. She has scalped me and broken both my legs. I
know they’ll have to be amputated!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very sorry, sir, I’m sure,” said mammy, as she reeled
about with the swinging of the coach, and finally dropped
into a vacant seat. “Very sorry, but you <i>will</i> keep a hitting
up agin me. I hope you aint hurt much?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>“Hurt much? I tell you you have crushed both my
knees to a pulp, and I know I shall have to get them taken
off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very sorry, sir! but I can recommend you to a doctor
as saws legs off beautiful, and likewise to a upholster who
sells elegant wooden ones,” said mammy, sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Many thanks! But how about my head? You have
pulled two great handfuls of hair out by the roots, and I
know I shall have to get the rest shaved!” laughed and
groaned Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir, I can direct you to a gentleman of the barbarous
line of business, who will shave your head as clean
as a peeled potaty, and sell you a lovely false wig.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A million of gratitudes! When I require your valuable
guidance I will seek it. But for the present, I begin to
suspect that my limbs were not quite crushed, but only benumbed;
and instead of being scalped outright I have only
lost a handful of hair,” said Dick, as he settled himself
comfortably in his seat, and subsided into silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How does you feel now, honey? Is you comformerble?”
inquired mammy, in a low tone, addressing her
charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>She received no answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do b’lieve how she’s sleep. How is you getting along,
honey?” repeated mammy. But with no better success.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do ’spose she <i>is</i> ’sleep! But, Lor’, I daren’t go nearer
to her to see for fear I should fall on her, and mash her,
which would be dreadful. Tell me if you is asleep, honey;
’cause if you is I won’t wake you up,” said mammy, raising
her voice, and listening attentively.</p>

<p class='c011'>But still she received no reply,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wonder what’s the matter with her?” muttered mammy,
uneasily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s asleep,” answered Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>“Well, if she’s ’sleep, why couldn’t she tell me so when
I axed her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has told you so,” replied Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’! why she hasn’t said a single word!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; but she has told you so in the only way a sleeper
could,—by her silence. If she had been awake, she would
have spoken; wouldn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure enough; I never thought of that before. See
what it is to have a head-piece. But is you sartain sure
she is asleep?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certain sure,” answered Dick, bending forward, and
listening to the soft, low, regular breathing of his invisible
fellow-passenger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, thank Goodness for that!” said mammy, as she
settled herself to rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stage-coach had been thundering on its way at a
tremendous rate for several miles, but now it had to cross a
broad but shallow stream and to go slowly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly, Dick yawned, and then, addressing his fat
neighbor, inquired:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does your ladyship object to smoking?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir,” replied mammy, sharply; “my ladyship <i>do</i>
very much so, indeed; and so do my missus,—which, sleeping
or ’waking, I believe it would make her sick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, your missus! True? Well, let’s see what sort of
weather it is outside—though, in point of fact, I had
rather bear the rain than forbear my cigar,” said Dick, as
he opened the window and looked forth into the blackness
of the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rain had ceased and the clouds had parted as with
the promise of clearing off entirely. A few stars were
shining out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come; not so bad a night after all. I have been out
in worse. And as soon as we get upon dry land again, I
think I will climb up on top and take a smoke. Eh, what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>do you say, Aunty? Shall I help you up also? I know
you’d like your pipe!” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I scorn your insiniwations, sir, and I ’vises of you, if
you is agoing out in the damp night air, as you’d better
take care and not get cold in your ‘raw head and bloody
bones,’ as you was a-complaining of.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks for your caution, Aunty. I shall be sure to
profit by it,” laughed Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then as the coach was slowly crawling out of the
mud that bordered the shallow stream, he called the coachman
to halt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish to get up on top,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when the man complied with his wishes, Dick left
his seat and went up.</p>

<p class='c011'>There now remained two other passengers besides Drusilla
and her attendant. These were two gentlemen that
occupied the corners of the front seat, with their backs to
the horses. But they sat so quietly that but for their
breathing and an occasional cough or low-toned word, mammy
would have been unconscious of their presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now Drusilla bent forward and cautiously touched
the nurse, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mammy, come and sit by me. I have something to
say to you. Don’t answer me aloud, but do as I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’, honey, is you waked up? It was that there man
a-making of his noise, getting outn’t his seat. Some people
can’t never keep quiet. But, honey, I’m afraid if I
moves I might fall on you,” said mammy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, you won’t; we have no jolts here. Guide yourself
by the left side of the seat, and I will give you my hand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, honey,” said the old woman, and slowly and carefully
she changed her “base,” and safely reached the haven
beside her mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse,” whispered Drusilla, “I have not been asleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My! haven’t you, honey? Why didn’t you answer
me, then?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>“Because I did not wish to talk. That gentleman who
got in just the moment before you, is a passenger that was
picked up at Drainsville, he is the same person who brought
me the bad news yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t say!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush! speak very low; we are not alone, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And to think I never knowed him agin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is not strange. It is quite too dark for you to
have seen his face. I only knew him by his voice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I heard his woice too; but I didn’t know it
agin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You heard it only in a moment of terror, and when its
very sound was unnatural. It is not strange that you
should not have recognized it again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’m sure! Where’s he going?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know, nurse. Probably where <i>we</i> are going.
But I do not wish him to recognize <i>me</i>, lest he should like
me to talk; and I cannot talk of my affairs. I say this to
caution you. Be on you guard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, honey, I’ll be on my guard. And you may keep
yourself dark during the night; but I don’t see how you
gwine to manage when it is daylight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must keep my veil down,” said Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, honey, I hope you will succeed.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Light here and there, like sparks of fire in seas of darkness.
Darkness within and without. The two red lamps
that flanked the coachman’s seat, the single lantern carried
by the guard, and the bright point of Dick’s cigar as he sat
smoking on the top of the coach, only seemed by contrast
to make that darkness deeper.</p>

<p class='c011'>The coach slowly clawed up a long hill at the summit of
which was a country inn, with its usual accessories of
grocery-store, blacksmith’s shop and post-office.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here all was cheerful bustle, with the glancing lights,
the voices of men, the tramp of steeds, and all the merry
movement of a way station.</p>

<p class='c011'>And here the coach stopped to change horses.</p>

<p class='c011'>The outside passenger jumped down and went into the
little bar-room of the inn, which Drusilla could see from her
window was half filled with country loafers and village politicians,
drinking, smoking, discussing the news, and settling
the elections. In two minutes the outside passenger was
“hail fellow, well met,” with every one of them, and generously
treating the whole company with the best in the
bar. Ah, poor Dick!</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the guard came to the coach door with his
lantern, and inquired if any of the ladies or gentlemen
desired to get out for refreshments, as they should stop
there fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two gentlemen on the front seat at once left the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>coach. As they got out, Drusilla saw that one was the
Reverend Mr. Hopper. The other was the stranger they
had taken up first in Washington.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they had disappeared, the guard turned to Drusilla
and repeated his question, whether she or her attendant
would like to leave the coach.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla politely declined to do so. But mammy got up
and tumbled out of the coach, and called to one of the hostlers;</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hey! I say! Come here, you sir, and fetch a light
this way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man who was thus summoned, thinking that some
accident had happened, ran to the spot, demanding:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want you just to look in that there leather place
behind, and see if them there little red morocky trunks is all
right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Blast you and your trunks too! Who do you think is
going to be bothered with them?” angrily retorted the
man as he left her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come in, nurse. Oh, <i>do</i> come in,” pleaded Drusilla,
from the window. “I am <i>sure</i> the trunks are all safe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But mammy was not in a very compliant humor. She
ran splashing through slop and mire, and burst into the bar-room,
exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, do, kind gentlemen, some of you come out and see
if them there two little red morocky trunks of the madam’s
is all right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The company around the fire stared at her in astonishment
and ridicule.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Dick, the most good-natured of all creatures, took up
a light and followed her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, sir,” she said, leading the way to the boot, “just
you pull apart these here flaps and hold the light so I can
peep in and see.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>Dick laughingly complied with her request.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, there they is, thank goodness, safe as <i>yet</i>. Thanky’
sir. Now I’ll get in the coach, please,” she said, with a
courtesy as she returned to the side of her charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it raining?” inquired Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, honey, but black as Beelzebub; so it must come
down heavy enough afore long. And now, honey, while
them there men is all out’n the way let me make you comfortable
for the night. You come over on this middle seat
while I make you a bed on the back one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla complied, for she was very, very weary with sitting
up so long.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy, with the help of a softly-packed carpet bag,
that served for a pillow, with a clean pocket handkerchief
spread over it for a case, and two large shawls for coverings,
made a very comfortable couch.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla took off her bonnet and hung it up, and loosened
her hair and her clothes, and lay down. And mammy tucked
her up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just at this moment came the guard with a tray and a
tumbler.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One of the gentlemen from the inn has sent this to the
lady with his respectful compliments, and begs she will take
it,” he said, as he handed the oiler in at the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, honey, you take it, and drink it, too. It’s a hot
mulled port wine negus, spiced; and it will warm you and
put you to sleep,” said mammy, as she took the glass from
the messenger and passed it to the mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poor, chilled, tired and nervous creature really needed
and felt that she needed just such a cordial at just that
hour. She inhaled its steamy, spicy fragrance with satisfaction
and desire, yet she hesitated to take it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know who sent it, nurse,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now what the mischief <i>that</i> got to do with it? Do
<i>that</i> make it hotter or worse? I s’pect the good-natured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>young man who ’cused me o’ scalping him and breaking of
his legs sent it. But that’s nyther here nor there. Whoever
sent it, sent it in kindness; and don’t you ever ’fuse
human kindness when you needs it, come from where it will,
’cause it hurts the feelings in the saftest place. Here,
honey, drink it while it’s steaming hot—hot as love.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said Drusilla, taking the glass and sipping the
cordial, “when you return the glass, send word to the
gentleman that I thank him very much for his thoughtfulness
in sending me this restorative, and that I know it will
do me good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Five minutes after, when Drusilla, having finished her
cordial, was comfortably reposing on her couch, and the
guard came for the glass, mammy delivered her message
thus:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell the young man as sent this that the madam says
how she’s very much obleeged to him for the hot stuff,
which it has gone right to the right place, and done her
good and no mistake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next moment the three gentlemen passengers took
their places inside the coach, two of them sitting on the
front seat in opposite corners, and one of them, Dick,
sitting on the middle seat beside mammy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The coach started again. The night was so dark, and
the down-hill road so steep, that its progress was cautiously
slow.</p>

<p class='c011'>The male passengers wrapped themselves closely in their
“mauds,” pulled their caps down over their eyes, and composed
themselves to sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy opened her luncheon basket, and, having first
hospitably offered to share its contents with each and all of
her fellow-passengers and been politely refused, set to work
and ate a very hearty supplementary supper off the best it
contained of food and drink, and then gathered up the
fragments and put them away.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>Finally, she took off her best bonnet—of the Quaker or
Methodist pattern,—hung it up beside her mistress’s, tied a
little woollen shawl over her head, wrapped a big one
around her shoulders, and resigned herself to rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon all were sleeping except Drusilla, who, physically
speaking, was more favorably placed for sleep than any of
the others. She lay very comfortably, really rocked, not
racked, by the swinging motion of the coach as it rolled
down hill. She was very tired, and so, in a bodily sense,
she almost enjoyed this soft reposing and easy rocking; but
she was not sleepy, for her mind was too active with the
thoughts of what lay around and before her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where was Dick Hammond and Mr. Hopper going?
Who was the tall, dark gentleman they had taken up at
Washington, and who certainly seemed to be of the same
party, since she had seen him signalling to Mr. Hopper?
Was their errand in the country connected with the same
sad business that was taking herself thither?</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick might be only going down in answer to his uncle’s
invitation to the wedding, she reflected. “But, no, not
so!” she thought, instantly repudiating the idea that
Richard Hammond, after all that he had said in reprobation
of the iniquitous marriage, could possibly sanction it
by his presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>But what then was he going for? and why was he taking
Mr. Hopper and that other gentleman—who looked as
if he were in some way connected with the law, along with
him?</p>

<p class='c011'>Was he going to denounce Alick to his uncle and cousin?
Was he taking Mr. Hopper down as a witness to Alick’s
former marriage? And the mysterious legal-looking gentleman
as a prosecutor?</p>

<p class='c011'>As these thoughts chased themselves through her mind,
she clasped her hands and moaned.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, were they all three combining to go and overwhelm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>her Alick, and cover him with humiliation and confusion?
she asked herself; and for the moment her Alick appeared
to her, not as a criminal pursued by the just avengers, but
as a victim hunted down by relentless persecutors, of whom
she saw herself the chief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, why—oh, why couldn’t I have kept still and let
him marry his cousin and be happy with her? Oh, Alick!
oh, poor Alick! But that would have been a crime. Ah,
Heaven, how hard is my lot to have to choose between
making him wretched or leaving him criminal!” she
moaned, twisting her fingers and weeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>She dreaded the coming of the morning. She feared the
daylight that might discover her face to these men, who
she thought were confederated to ruin her husband. She
dreaded their recognizing and speaking to her. But she
was determined to have nothing to say to them, or to do
with them; for, under present circumstances she felt that
any intercourse between her and them would look too much
like entering into their conspiracy. And now her whole
gentle soul revolted in horror from those three harmless
and unconscious gentlemen, who were reclining on the seats
before her, and “sleeping the sleep of innocence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes; all in the coach were at rest except herself. Nor
could she, with all her mental distress, very long resist the
influences that were wooing her to repose. Her excessive
bodily fatigue, combined with the soporific qualities of the
spiced cordial she had taken, the swinging motion of the
coach and the lulling sound of the falling rain, soon overcame
her consciousness, and she too slumbered in forgetfulness
of all her sorrows.</p>

<p class='c011'>She slept on for several hours, until she was awakened by
the flashing of lights, the hallooing of men and the trampling
of beasts, as the coach stopped to change horses at
one of the nosiest post-houses on the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>The other passengers were aroused at the same time.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>Mammy awoke from some dream of her professional
duties, yawned, stretching her jaws almost to dislocation,
and thereby discovering a most fearful abyss, and still
dreaming, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yaw-aw! Yes, honey! Tell the madam I’ll be up
and dressed in one minute. And tell that boy to run for
the doctor. Ow! Yaw-aw!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But at this noisy station the people were very active.
And before the good woman could collect her faculties the
coach started, and she herself was again precipitated down
into the land of “Nod.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla could not sleep again, so to ease her position she
sat up and reclined back in the corner of her seat, and in a
dreamy, half-conscious condition she gazed through the
opposite window.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first it seemed but a solid wall of darkness past which
the coach was so swiftly whirling; but gradually, as her
eyes accustomed themselves to the circumstances, this darkness
grew less opaque, this obscurity less impenetrable,
until at length she could dimly discern the boundaries of
mountains, valleys, forests, and the outlines of rocks, trees
and buildings.</p>

<p class='c011'>At long intervals she could perceive the form of some
solitary farm-house, with its barn, shed, cattle-pen, field,
orchard and garden. Half waking, she would wonder who
lived and worked there; and half sleeping, she would people
the place with the beings of her dream.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes she saw a lonely woodcutter’s cottage on the
edge of a forest, and vaguely conjectured what sort of life
its denizens led. Once in such a place she saw a single
light burning in the tiny window of a little upper chamber,
in the interior of which the shadow of a woman was bending
over the shadow of a sick-bed. She had but a glimpse
of all this, as the coach rolled past, yet her ready sympathies
went forth to the poor watcher and the suffering invalid.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>Once she was treated to a brilliant picture in the darkness—an
oasis in the desert. It was a bran new, commodious
country house, well seated on a hill; lights were glancing
from every window; music was borne forth upon the
wind; even in that inclement weather, somebody seemed to
be giving a great party and to be keeping it up all night.
But before she could observe more the coach had rushed by
and left the festive scene far behind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once she noticed a little road-side hut, and in its doorway,
a poor, old woman, thinly clad, holding a lantern in
her hand and bending outward in an attitude of intense
anxiety, as if looking for some one. “In her poor way, she
is watching and waiting, as I used to do. Has she a husband,
or perhaps a son, who is breaking her heart?” mused
Drusilla, as the coach swung onward and left this sad picture
also in its rear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such signs of life, however, were very rare, on that lonely
road, at that late hour. The few hamlets, farms and huts
they passed were for the most part shut up, dark and silent
as graves.</p>

<p class='c011'>But they were now penetrating deeper and deeper into
the mountain fastnesses; and farm-houses and villages were
fewer and farther between. For miles and miles nothing
but the most savage solitudes loomed in the blackness of
darkness through which they passed. And Drusilla, reclining
back in her corner, dreamily gazing forth through the
rain-dimmed window upon this obscure scene, vaguely wondered
when these solitudes would be peopled, when this
wilderness would “bloom and blossom as the rose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so, while all her fellow-passengers were deeply
buried in unconsciousness, she dreamed on her waking
dream. But often in the midst of these reveries the sudden
sharp recollection of her own trouble pierced her heart like
a sword and drew from her lips a bitter groan. Then again
the influence of the scene and hour, the obscurity, the picturesqueness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>the rocking motion of the coach, the soothing
sound of the falling rain without, the silence and stillness
of all within, lulled her senses to repose if not to sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, slumbering, dreaming, starting, waking, she
passed this weird night, that ever in her after life seemed
to her less like the reality than like the phantasmagoria of
a hasheesh-conjured vision.</p>

<p class='c011'>Towards morning, being very much wearied with sitting
up, she lay down again, and, as is usual with uneasy sleepers,
just at daylight she fell into a deep and dreamless
sleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>She slept profoundly and until she was rudely awakened
by a shock of noise and action.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was now broad day, and it was raining hard. The
coach was drawn up before the door of the large, low building,
the one hotel in the mountain hamlet. Hostlers and
porters were crowding around it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla lay quietly in her shadowy recess, resolved not
to move until the male passengers had left the stage, which
she saw they were preparing to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>First, Dick Hammond climbed over mammy, who was
still fast asleep, and got out. Then the minister and the
lawyer, one after the other, surmounted the same obstruction
and passed on the same way. And these three gentlemen
went into the bar-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>But mammy slept on.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>Drusilla sat up and quickly tightened her own dress and
put on her bonnet. And then she tried to wake her attendant,
but without success; for mammy did nothing but
yawn and talk in her sleep and settle herself to rest again;
until the guard came, and, shaking her roughly, shouted in
her ears:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, come, old woman! wake up and get out! the
coach stops here to breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yaw! yaw! I just said how it would be! I know’d
it would happen before morning!” said mammy, yawning
fearfully and then opening her eyes and exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! why, what’s this? Where is we, to be sure?
Oh, I members! This must be Frostville. And now I
wonder if them there little red morocky trunks is safe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, nurse, of course they are safe. And now
come and do let us get into the hotel as quickly as possible,”
said Drusilla, impatiently, for she saw that the people
in charge of the stage were vexed at the delay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Lor’, honey, is <i>you</i> awake at last? Well, I
declare! How sound you <i>did</i> sleep all night, to be sure!
and a blessed thing for you, too; but as for me, I couldn’t
close my eyes all the whole night, for watching of you, and
thinking of them there two little red morocky trunks. I
wonder if they <i>is</i> safe,” said mammy, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, blame you! Come, get out! I can’t stop here
waiting on you all day,” said the guard, half angrily. And
with very little ceremony he bundled the old woman out of
the coach.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then he hoisted an umbrella, and held it over the
delicate young invalid as he helped her to alight, and led
her across to the private door of the hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy followed, dragging all her belongings, and
grumbling:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I haven’t seen them there little red morocky trunks
yet, which it is my private belief that the guards is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>league with the highway robbers, same as they say the
p’lice is with the burglarians in the towns; and they
’wides spiles, share and share alike, that I do. Goodness
knows, one needs to have one’s eyes all around one’s head,
and all of ’em wide open all the time, to watch these
fellers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse, be quiet. The trunks are safe; or, if they are
not, the loss is mine,” said Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The loss may be yours, but the illconweniency is mine,
ma’am. How in the world am I to do my perfessional
dooty without my proper conveniences?” inquired mammy.</p>

<p class='c011'>But before her question could be answered, the guard
had conducted her mistress into the best parlor of the
humble hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a very pleasant place to come into out of the rain;
a spacious room with a low ceiling, and an ample fire-place
with a huge fire of pine and oak wood roaring and blazing
up the chimney; on the floor a home made carpet; at the
windows, home made blue paper blinds; along the walls,
country manufactured chip-bottomed chairs and chintz-covered
sofas; over the wooden mantel-piece, the oldest
fashioned looking-glass, ornamented with peacock’s
feathers;—altogether it was a room breathing of real rustic
life, and very refreshing after velvet carpets, satin damask
draperies, gilded chairs, and cheval mirrors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many doors opened from this large, low parlor into many
other rooms, for in this mountain region the houses were all
built on one floor and of one story, to protect them from
injury by the high winds of that locality.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla stood for a little while before this beautiful fire,
basking in its genial warmth; and then to relieve her long
cramped limbs, she walked up and down the cheerful room
and looked through the windows upon the busy scene without,
in which landlord, postmaster, coachman, guard and
hostlers seemed all to take an important part.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>Tired of this view, she turned from the windows, and
then, from an open door on the left side of the fire-place,
she had a view of the long coffee-room, in which was set
forth a very inviting breakfast. There all her fellow-passengers,
as well as many other persons, were impatiently
waiting for the signal to sit down to the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla not wishing to join this company, went to the
bell and rang it peremptorily.</p>

<p class='c011'>A chamber-maid answered the summons.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I have a bedroom at once?” inquired the lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, ma’am, certainly. This way, if you please,”
smiled the woman, opening one of the many doors and
leading the way into an inner chamber of the same general
character as the parlor, except that it was furnished with a
bed and a toilet table, with pure white dimity hangings,
and a wash-stand with a plenty of fresh water and clean
towels.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla threw herself into the white draperied easy chair,
before the blazing wood-fire, and then inquired—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I have breakfast for myself and my attendant
served here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, ma’am, certainly,” assented the woman, in
what seemed to be her stereotyped phrase.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I would like to have it soon, if you please,” said
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl went away to execute her orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, left alone with her nurse, laid off her bonnet,
and bathed her face and hands and arranged her hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>While engaged in this refreshing process, she overheard
voices speaking in the parlor she had just left.</p>

<p class='c011'>They appeared to belong to Dick and his companions,
and they seemed to be discussing with the landlord the
speediest manner in which to prosecute their journey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You say the new Bee-line of coaches across country is
started, landlord?” spoke Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>“Yes, sir; started on Monday. The road was first
opened on Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At what hour do they pass here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At half-past ten, sir, almost to a minute.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And they pass directly through Hammondsville?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Directly, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Hammondsville is within six or eight miles of Old
Lyon Hall, while Saulsburg is nine or ten miles off. Besides,
at Hammondsville, I shall be near enough to my
place, Hammond Hill, to get my own horses, with altogether
a better chance of reaching our destination to-night.
Come! I have a good mind to have my luggage taken
off, and to wait for the Bee-line coach. What do you
say, gentlemen!” inquired Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I say that we had best first be sure that we can get
places in the new coach before we give up our seats in the
old one. ‘A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,’
you know,” answered the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are the chances of our obtaining places, landlord?”
inquired the clergyman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How many places do you want, gentlemen?” inquired
‘my host.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only three; and, rather than miss, we would not mind
taking outside places.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, be at ease, sir; I can almost insure you places on
these terms, either outside or inside. At this season of the
year, the coaches are very seldom crowded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right!” said Dick, “I will go and have our luggage
taken off this one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank Heaven, we are going to lose our fellow-passengers!”
exclaimed Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thanks Heaven, too, for that same. But long’s that
young man’s gwine to have his luggidge took off I must go
and see that he don’t get hold of them there two little red
morocky trunks,” said mammy, starting off for the door.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>“Indeed you shall do no such thing,” said Drusilla, laying
hold of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why musn’t I then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because in the first place the trunks are in no sort of
danger. Gentlemen are not thieves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And in the second place, I would rather lose the whole
of our luggage than have that gentleman recognize you, as
I believe he fortunately failed to do last night. Sit down
and keep quiet. I insist upon it, nurse!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old woman dropped down into a chair, grumbling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I’d like to know what we is to do if them there two
little red morocky trunks is lost or stolen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The risk is mine alone, nurse. And now hush, for here
is the waiter come to lay the cloth for our breakfast,” said
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very soon a most delicious morning meal was laid before
them—fragrant coffee, maple-sugar, rich cream, hot rolls,
fresh butter, venison steaks, pure honey—luxuries to be
found in their perfections only on the mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy inhaled the aromas arising from this breakfast
table as though every breath was a delight. She coaxed
and scolded her mistress into making a very good meal.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then she made a very much better one herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>After this they prepared to resume their journey.</p>

<p class='c011'>In going out to take her seat in the coach, Drusilla drew
down her veil to avoid recognition, in any chance-meeting
with Mr. Hammond. She need not have done so, for poor
Dick was in the bar-room treating his friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>The weather was worse than ever. From the clouds
above the rain was pouring in torrents; from the valleys
below the vapors were rising in heavy fogs. The boundaries
of the mountain scenery were lost in mist.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day was as dim with a white obscurity as the night
had been with a black one.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>Drusilla and her attendant had the inside of the coach
all to themselves for the next few hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla, almost worn out with her journey, reclined at
nearly full length upon the back seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy, having asked and obtained leave, lay down upon
the front seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>The remainder of their journey passed monotonously
enough, being varied only by the stopping of the coach at
the regular post-houses to change horses, and by the altercations
between mammy and the guard relative to the
safety of “them there two little red morocky trunks,”
which the guard mentally consigned to the demon full fifty
times before they reached their destination.</p>

<p class='c011'>About noon they stopped to change horses at a small
hamlet, where they were joined by other passengers—two
honest, good-humored-looking countrymen, who immediately
upon their entrance, began to talk of the great wedding
which was to come off that same night at Old Lyon
Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>From their talk Drusilla understood that she was
approaching the neighborhood of the old manor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deeply interested in the subject of their conversation,
she first forced herself to listen calmly, and then to speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you tell me how far we are from Old Lyon
Hall?” she inquired of the elder man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, goodness, no, Miss, not exactly; though if I
were to hazard a guess, I should say betwixt twenty and
thirty miles, more or less,” answered the man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the nearest point at which the road passes the
hall?” she next inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, for the life of me, Miss, I could not tell! But
the nearest stopping-place is Saulsburg; and that’s pretty
near twenty miles off here, I know. Might you be going
to the Old Hall, Miss?” inquired the traveller, feeling
quite free to follow her example and ask questions in his
turn.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>“I am going to Saulsburg,” answered Drusilla, evasively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!—There’s to be a grand wedding at the old Hall
to-night, Miss,” said the traveller.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So I have heard,” coldly answered Drusilla, almost
regretting that she had opened a conversation with this
traveller, and wishing now to close it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the good man was well started on the great subject
of the day and the place, and he would talk of nothing but
the wedding, and to nobody but Drusilla, thinking, doubtless,
that a lady, and a young lady too, would be most likely
to feel interested in the theme.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortunately for Drusilla, her talkative fellow-passenger
got out at the very next stopping-place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, having passed the greatest range of the mountains,
they were coming into a rather better settled portion of the
country, and way-passengers were getting in or out at every
post-house; and the theme of conversation with every one
of these was—not the crops, nor the races, nor the elections,
but—the grand wedding to come off that night at old Lyon
Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>About three o’clock in the afternoon they reached the
little hamlet of Saulsburg, consisting merely of a small inn
and a half a dozen cottages, nestled at the foot of the Wild
Mountain and upon the banks of the Wild River.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Drusilla and her attendant got out, in a pouring
rain.</p>

<p class='c011'>The kind-hearted guard hoisted his large umbrella, and
led her into the shelter of the little inn parlor, and then
went back to the coach to see to the removal of her luggage.
He found mammy in high dispute with the porter—subject
of debate, of course, “them there two little red morocky
trunks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here they are!” said the guard, as the treasures were
taken from the boot and set upon the ground; “here they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>are, blast ’em, and I’m blowed if I don’t wish I may never
set eyes on you or your blamed trunks again as long as ever
I live in this world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so I sees my little red morocky trunks safe, I shan’t
tear the clothes offen my back for grief if I never sees <i>you</i>
again; so there now!” retorted mammy, as she loaded herself
with shawls, carpet-bags, and umbrellas, and followed
the porter who carried the precious little trunks into the
house.</p>

<p class='c011'>The luggage was all set down in the hall, and, leaving it
there, mammy went into the parlor, where she found her
mistress still in her travelling dress, impatiently walking
up and down the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to see the landlord, nurse. I have rung twice,
but no one has come. You go and try to find him and
bring him here. I must have a carriage to convey me
to Old Lyon Hall this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness! ain’t you tired of travelling yet? And
must you set off on another journey again directly,” exclaimed
mammy, in dismay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not at the end of my first journey yet, nurse, nor
shall I be until I reach old Lyon Hall. It is there that I
am bound. So go now and call the landlord to me,” urged
Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before mammy could either obey or expostulate, the landlord
himself came in, in answer to Drusilla’s first summons.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I have a close carriage immediately, to take me to
old Lyon Hall?” anxiously inquired Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>The landlord looked surprised at such an unusual demand
and, after staring and rubbing his head, answered, slowly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, bless your heart, Miss, there ain’t such a thing
as a close carriage in the whole willage!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, an open one then—any sort of one, so that it can
be got ready at once,” said Drusilla, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But there ain’t any sort of a carriage about the place,
Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>“A gig, then, a gig would do,” said Drusilla, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We haven’t got such a thing, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good heavens, sir, I <i>must</i> have some conveyance to
take me to Old Lyon Hall this afternoon. I do not care
what it costs!” said Drusilla, desperately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you’ll be on your way to the wedding there,
Miss?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, I am going there. Can you get me a conveyance
of some sort from some one in the neighborhood?
I will pay well for the use of any sort of a carriage to
take me to the old hall. And I will pay you well for
your trouble in getting it for me. Answer, quickly—can
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear me, how anxious young folks is for weddings, to
be sure!—Stay, let’s see—Yes! There’s old Mr. Simpkins—he
would hire his carryall, I know, and glad to do it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get it, then! I will pay whatever he asks. How long
will it take you to get it?” asked Drusilla, breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you see,” said the landlord, very leisurely, “Old
man Simpkins he lives about a mile from here; and if I
put a boy on horseback and send him right off we might
get the carryall here at the door inside of an hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do it then at once; pray hurry! I will pay you in
proportion to the haste that you make.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The leisurely landlord sauntered out of the parlor to give
his directions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla paced up and down the floor in great excitement.
The nearer she came to her journey’s end the more anxious
and agitated she felt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammy stood and watched her in growing wonder.
Suddenly mammy spoke out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What wedding this they all talking ’bout? I thought
we was agoing to see a wery sick man, not a wedding.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps to see both, nurse! But pray do not talk to
me if you can help it. I am scarcely sane!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>“Which such has been my opinion for some time past,”
said mammy, sententiously, leaving her patient to pace up
and down the room until the latter had paced off some of
her excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>The landlord put his head into the door, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The boy has gone after the carriage, Miss, and you may
rely on his being back here in an hour’s time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks. How far do you really think it is from this
place to old Lyon Hall?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why Miss, some people calls it ten miles, but I don’t
believe it is more than eight at the outside.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And how long will it take for me to get there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me see,” said the landlord in his leisurely way.
“It’s three o’clock now, ain’t it? Yes—well, the boy’ll be
back by four, and if you start then you’ll get there by six
or seven. You’ll be there in time to dress for the wedding,
Miss, which I hear is to be performed by special license at
eight o’clock in the evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well. Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, Miss, is there anything else we can do for
you?” inquired the slow host.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; thanks. Yes! you may send a chamber-maid
here,” replied Drusilla, incoherently, for in her intense
excitement she scarcely knew what she was in need of, or
what she was talking about.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the host had taken his little round head out of the
doorway, mammy, who had kept silence for some time,
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, ma’am, if so it is that you <i>will</i> go farther and
fare worse to-night, and if you have an hour before you I
strongly ’vises of you to take a bedroom and lie down until
it is time for you to start, and then to take a cup of tea
before you <i>do</i> start. You must keep up your strength. If
the matter you come ’bout is so very important, it won’t do
for you to break down, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>Drusilla stopped in her excited walk and reflected. The
advice of the nurse was very good. There were other
reasons besides care for her own comfort to induce her to
engage rooms here. For one thing, she intended to leave
her nurse in charge of the luggage, for she was resolved to
have no more witnesses to the humiliation of her poor
Alick than was absolutely unavoidable; and for another
thing, she was resolved to stay no longer at the Old Hall
than was necessary to do her painful errand there, but to
return as soon as possible to the inn. Therefore, she answered
mammy assentingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are right, nurse. You generally are so, in fact.
Here comes the chamber-maid I sent for, and I will order
rooms.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A bright-eyed negro girl stood in the doorway, curtseying
and waiting orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a few words the lady gave them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl went away to obey them.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in ten minutes Drusilla found herself in a small,
clean, warm room, where she unloosed her clothes and lay
down upon the bed, and, overcome by fatigue and excitement,
fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, thank the Goodness Gracious for that. But who
in the world would have thought it?” said mammy, as she
quietly closed the shutters and darkened the room, and sat
down to watch by her patient to try to guard her from disturbance
until the carriage should come.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the landlord’s hour stretched to two, and still the
carriage did not appear and still the sleeper slept on.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, however, mammy heard the sound of wheels.</p>

<p class='c011'>She went to the window, cautiously unclosed the shutters,
looked out, and saw the most dilapidated old carryall she
had ever set her eyes upon approaching the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s it! and a purty object it is!” said mammy, as
she went and looked to see what time it was by her mistress’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>watch that lay upon the dressing-table. It was a
quarter past five.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear me!” said the old woman in dismay, “when
she finds out how late it is, and she so anxious to be off,
she’ll just go and fling herself into fits, and then there!
Let see! I gwine save her all that, and ’ceive her for her
own good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so saying, mammy opened the watch and turned
back the hands from a quarter <i>past five</i> to a quarter <i>to four</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she stole out of the room and told the waiter to
bring a cup of tea and a round of toast upstairs quicker
than he ever did anything in his life before.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she went back to her patient, lamenting that she
must wake up out of such a refreshing sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>But to her surprise and satisfaction, she found Drusilla
already up and standing before the dressing-table, looking
at her watch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ma’am, are you awake? I’m so glad you got your
sleep out! You <i>did</i> get it out, didn’t you, honey? Nobody
waked you, did they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, nurse, I woke because I had slept long enough;
and I feel much strengthened and quite equal to pursue my
journey. It is ten minutes to four. I am so glad I didn’t
oversleep myself. I suppose the carriage will be here
soon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The carriage has almost just this minute come, and a
purty ramshackly old concern it is too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind, nurse, so that it will take me to my destination.
Come, help me to dress quickly. Dear me, what
a very dark afternoon,” said Drusilla, going nearer the
window for light.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am, the clouds do make it very dark indeed,”
said mammy, smiling in her sleeve at the deception she
had played off upon her mistress—“but here, ma’am, here
comes the waiter with lights and the tea tray,” she added,
as she arose and set out a little table.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>“I have no time to spend in eating and drinking,” said
Drusilla, as she hastily put on her bonnet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you must keep up your strength, ma’am,” urged
mammy leading her charge to the table and making her sit
down at it, while she herself poured out a cup of tea and
handed it to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse,” said Drusilla, as she received the cup from
the old woman, “I shall leave you here in charge of the—<i>two
little red morocco trunks</i>—until I return.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness, honey, you will never think of going
alone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must, nurse. There is no reason why I should
not. I feel quite equal to the ride. I am going to see
my husband.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, honey, I know if you will do a thing, <i>you
will do it</i>! When will you send for me and the luggage,
honey?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I may <i>come</i> for you and the luggage even to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, you mustn’t, indeed! No use for you to do that,
nyther. I reckon I ain’t afraid to stay alone in a decent
inn all night for once in a night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, nurse; then you may expect me to come or
send for you to-morrow. And now here is my purse—do
you pay the landlord and make yourself comfortable. I am
going now,” said Drusilla, rising to put on her waterproof
cloak.</p>

<p class='c011'>The nurse helped her on with that and with her overshoes,
and then accompanied her down stairs and saw her
safely into the old carryall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And here’s your umberel, honey. And you driver boy!
when the madam gets out, you be sure to hoist the umberel
and hold it over her head to ’vent her getting wet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, ma’am, I won’t forget to do it,” said the lad,
cracking his whip, starting his old horse, and making the
dilapidated vehicle rattle and shake, at every turn of the
wheels, as if it would drop to pieces.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>Drusilla sat back in her seat, uncomfortably jolted in the
miserable old carriage over that rough road, until, when
about a mile from the house, it actually and hopelessly broke
down.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Drusilla was sure of this mishap, she took off her
bonnet, drew the hood of her waterproof cloak over her
head, and set forth to walk the distance to Old Lyon Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of that heroic effort, and of its successful issue—her safe
arrival—the reader is already informed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The bride elect listened to the words of the forsaken
wife, first in surprise and incredulity, then in pity and
indignation, and last in a rapture of relief, ineffable and
indescribable, and only to be equalled by the ecstacy a condemned
criminal must feel when at the last moment before
execution he receives a full pardon.</p>

<p class='c011'>When all was told, Drusilla sat pale and despairing.
Anna flushed and resolute.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not for myself,” said the poor young wife, “not for myself,
Heaven knows, and not for you, but for his sake have
I done this thing—to save him from doing, in his madness,
a deed that the law might construe into a crime and punish
with degradation. But oh, Miss Lyon, forgive me if in
coming here I have brought you much sorrow!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush! you have brought me no sorrow, but a great
deliverance,” said Anna with a sigh of infinite relief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you never loved him—as I do!” exclaimed Drusilla,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>raising her large eyes, full of questioning wonder to
the face of Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Lyon smiled haughtily, for all reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That, at least, is well,” mused the young wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna arose, still flushed and resolute.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give me that document of which you spoke, my child,”
she said, extending her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla drew from her bosom the little black silk bag,
took from it the piece of paper in question, and laid it
before Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna read it over, with smiling eyes and a curling lip.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does it prove or disprove my marriage?” anxiously
inquired Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot tell, Drusilla; I do not know. But so much
is certain—<i>your</i> fate, Alick’s, and your unborn child’s, and
also my fate and Dick’s—all hang upon this precious little
piece of paper, for which I would not take a mint of
money,” said Anna, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And yet you cannot tell me whether it proves or disproves
my marriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; for I am not sufficiently learned in the law,” said
Anna, moving towards the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are going out?” said Drusilla, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; stay here until I come back, which will be in a
few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Lyon! Miss Lyon, do not go to him yet!
And do not upbraid him when you see him! Your provocation
may have been very great, but wait until you are
cool, and then you will be just,” pleaded the young wife,
rising and laying her hands upon the lady’s robes, to stay
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Child, I am not going to him. And I shall <i>never</i> upbraid
him,” replied Anna, with a superb and beautiful
scorn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you go——?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>“To my grandfather’s study!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To denounce him to his uncle? Oh, do not—not yet,
not just yet! Wait, wait till you are calm! till you can
speak only the words of justice and mercy. Do not
denounce him yet!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, I am not going to denounce him now or ever.
Wait <i>you</i>, and see what I shall do!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall save the miserable sinner, if he is to be saved at
all!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, how? oh, how?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait <i>you</i>, and trust me!” answered Anna, flashing
out of the room and taking the mysterious little document
with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She walked—no, in the exhilaration of her spirits, she
almost danced down the hall, towards her grandfather’s
little study, over the great entrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she tripped on she noticed the chamber-doors on each
side wide open, and the fire light within shining down on
the polished dark oak floors. In many of the rooms, the
chamber-maids were putting on fresh logs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think you need not take that trouble. I fancy there
will be no wedding guests here to-night,” said Anna, smiling,
as she passed them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Richard has come, Miss,” replied one of the
women.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” exclaimed Anna, stopping short with a beating
heart. A few seconds she paused to recover composure, and
then she rushed on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, my darling! have you come to show yourself to
me in all your bridal glory, before you go down to be married?
Ah! truly, you look very beautiful, my Anna.
May Heaven make your spirit even more beautiful than its
outward form,” said the fine old soldier, reaching out his
hand to his grand-daughter, as she entered his room, and
drawing her towards him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>“I am very glad that you are pleased with me, grandfather,”
she said, as she seated herself on his knee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You look happier now, my Anna, than you did half an
hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I feel happier, dear sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what makes the difference?” he smiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘A change has come over the spirit of my dream;’ that
is all,” laughed Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, my dear! feminine caprice, but I am glad of it.
Well, you are ready, Alick is ready, I am ready, and Dick
is here; but we have no bridesmaid and no minister.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, grandpa, we have a bridesmaid!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! I am glad of that! Which of the six young
ladies is it who has braved the storm for love of you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Annie,” answered Miss Lyon, evasively, meaning our
Anna Drusilla, but wishing her grandpa to understand
another Anna, as he did, for he immediately exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! little Annie Seymour! Well she lived nearest!
and she must answer for the whole six. But my dear, the
carriage has not yet returned with the minister.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The way is long and the roads are very bad. Doubtless
he will come; but it may be late. Was there a special
license got out for us, dear grandpa?” inquired Anna,
speaking with assumed carelessness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, of course, there was, my dear!” answered the
old soldier, elevating his eyebrows in astonishment, at the
question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who got it?” dear grandpa.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Alick, to be sure! who else?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who has it now, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bless my soul, what an inquisitive little puss. What
is it to you who has it? Are you afraid it is not all right?
Would you like to inspect it for yourself?” laughed the
general.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please; yes, sir, I should,” answered Anna,
archly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>“Lest there should be any informality in it, eh?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such things have happened, sir; but it is not the fear
of that which prompts me; for I have always had a curiosity
to look at a special marriage license; so if Alick has
it, please get it from him, that I may gratify this wish. I
only want it for a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, of all the whims of whimsical women, yours is
certainly the most absurd!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you get the license away from Alick, and let me
look at it grandpa?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You persist in this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, fortunately, I have not got to go to Alick with
such a ridiculous request as the loan of a license. I have
it here with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. You see Alick, thinking from the state of the
weather, and the looks of things generally, that he should
have no groomsman for the ceremony, put his marriage
license and the minister’s fee both in one envelope, and
requested me, when the proper time should come, to hand
it over to Dr. Barbar. But, now I hear that Dick has
arrived—having so far conquered himself as to come to the
wedding. I mean to conscript him into the service, arm
him with this paper, and make him do duty as groomsman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is the packet, dear grandpa?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, my dear, since you must needs see the license
(which the officiating clergyman scarcely ever does, as he
takes its contents for granted), you may read it at your
leisure, while I go down stairs and inquire if my messenger
has returned from the parsonage,” said General Lyon, as
he handed a white embossed envelope to the bride elect, and
then left the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sank down into an easy chair and opened the envelope,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>which of course was not sealed. She took out the marriage
license, in which she found folded a five hundred
dollar bank note.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a curling lip and flashing eyes she read over the
form of license, and then, with a smile of scorn and
triumph, she put it on the glowing fire and watched it blaze
up and burn to ashes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she took that mysterious little document given her
by Drusilla, wrapped it around the big bank note and put
both in the envelope and folded it neatly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Mr. Alexander Lyon, whoever you may marry to-night,
you will certainty not marry me!” she mused,
maliciously, as she sat and waited for her grandfather’s
return. Presently she heard footsteps coming up the corridor;
but they were not those of the old General.</p>

<p class='c011'>She arose to her feet and her heart stood still.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick Hammond entered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna! You here? Pardon me, I expected only to
find my uncle,” he exclaimed, in a voice vibrating with
emotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick! dear Dick! you are welcome! Shake hands,
Dick. No, take it! it is a free hand now. I know all,
Dick!” exclaimed Anna trembling with excess of agitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>He clasped her hand and carried it to his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I came here to tell your grandfather everything and to
prove all that I should tell. But I have been anticipated.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Drusilla is here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew she was on her way. I came a night’s journey
with her in the coach. But I saw that she tried to escape
recognition by me; for what reason I could not guess; so,
not to trouble her with my presence, in the morning I got
off the coach and took another route. I feared that she
would not be able to continue her journey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She arrived this evening,” said Anna, calmly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>“And she has told you all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And <i>what</i> does your grandfather think of this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He does not know it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How? not know it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Dick. Drusilla told me only. I have not told my
grandfather, nor do I intend to do so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I myself I will denounce the scoundrel to my
uncle,” exclaimed Hammond, shaking with passion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Dick, we will not denounce him. We will do a
deal better than that. Listen, Dick: My dear old grandpa
says he intends to conscript you into the service to do
duty as groomsman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He does!” exclaimed Hammond, with his eyes flashing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and, Dick, you must consent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Consent! <i>I</i> consent! Anna, do you mean this iniquitous
marriage to go on?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I do. And Dick, you must be groomsman and
hand the license and the fee both over to the minister. See,
here they are in this pretty envelope. Grandpa got it ready
for you. So, Dick, you must do it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I do, may I he eternally consigned to the deepest pit
in—”</p>

<p class='c011'>—“Hush, Dick, and don’t go off at a tangent. Look
me in the face, sir! right in the eyes!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna, what do you mean?” he inquired, meeting her
steady gaze.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you see anything ‘iniquitous’ in my countenance?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; but I see a mystery there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A holy mystery, as I suppose a ‘pious fraud’ may be
called. Now, sir, will you open this envelope, which is to
be entrusted to you, to be delivered to the minister, and examine
its contents?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>“Why,” said Dick in perplexity, as he looked at the enclosure,
“this is—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it <i>is</i>. I have taken advantage of my grandpa’s
absence to burn my marriage license and substitute this one.
And <i>you</i> must hand it enclosed in the envelope, with the
fee, to the minister, when we stand up to be married. And
<i>now</i>, Dick, do you begin to see daylight?” laughed Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I do. Yet I do not quite comprehend yet.
You mean—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here comes my grandfather, and we have not a minute
more for explanation. Play the part assigned to you—blindly,
if you must—and trust me with the issue. Will
you, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I <span class='fss'>WILL</span>, Anna.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Dick, here, listen quick!—Just before I am to be
sent for, go down into the great drawing-room and put out
two thirds of the wax candles. I want a subdued light, not
an illumination there. Will you remember, Dick, and do it
yourself, so as to insure its being done?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Anna, I will; and now I <i>do</i> begin to understand
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, here he is!” whispered Miss Lyon, as her grandfather
came to the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Dick, my dear boy! how are you? so glad to see
you!” exclaimed old General Lyon, entering and holding
out his hand to Richard Hammond, who took and pressed it
affectionately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So very glad to see you here, Dick! Your very first
visit to Old Lyon Hall! And now I shall expect you to
stay and comfort me when my young people are gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be very happy to do so, sir,” answered Dick,
sincerely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how the deuce did you find your way here, through
this wilderness of a country, and over these dreadful
roads?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>“Oh, I inquired of your protegées, the old Scotch
emigrants, at the turnpike gate,” answered Dick, laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Old Andy and Jenny. Ay, poor souls! Well, Dick,
you are here in a good hour. All our guests have failed us—groomsmen,
and bridesmaids, and all, except little Annie
Seymour. And so you must play groomsman, and lead
Annie down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be very happy to do so, sir, if Alick desires it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, he does. I heard that you were here, and so I
looked in at Alick’s room and mentioned the matter to him.
And he declared that he would be very much obliged if
you would do him so much honor. So, you will see it is all
right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And here, Dick, is the license and the fee, both in this
envelope, which it will be your duty as groomsman to hand
to the officiating minister.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And, by the way, I hear wheels, and his carriage must
be coming,” said the old gentleman, leaving the study to
inquire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, the bride elect had returned to her own
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla still sat there in the easy chair, with her hands
clasped upon her lap and her head bowed upon her breast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna went and took a seat beside her, and said, with
earnestness almost amounting to solemnity:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, if you wish to save Alick from guilt and remorse,
and yourself and your child from wrong and shame,
you must place your destiny in my hands to-night, and do
as I direct you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The helpless young wife looked up in the lady’s face, and
murmured mournfully:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a great trust you seek, Miss Lyon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It <i>is</i>, Drusilla, a very great trust; yet I seek it. It is
also for you a very great trial, yet I ask you to meet it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>“I would meet anything for Alick’s sake, Miss Lyon, if
I may save him, as you say. Please to explain yourself,
Miss Lyon,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, you know that Alexander Lyon is waiting
and expecting to marry me to-night,” said the bride elect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” moaned the wronged wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And my grandfather and his household are equally
waiting and expecting to witness a wedding.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, they must not any of them be disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, what do you mean?” inquired Drusilla, with an
anxious sigh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not to marry Alick myself, you may rest assured,” answered
Anna, disdainfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, no, for you could not do that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course not, as I consider him already married. You
are his wife, in right, if not in law, Drusilla,” said Miss
Lyon, emphatically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I <i>know</i> I am so by right, and I <i>believe</i> I am so by law,”
answered Drusilla solemnly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet those who know more of law than we do differ
from us. And this makes your position, Drusilla, very
doubtful, very unsafe, and deeply humiliating.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it, I feel it, through all my darkened spirit and
in every pulse of my breaking heart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This state of affairs should not be permitted to exist for
a moment, especially—oh, most especially—as you are so
soon to be a mother. No question of the lawfulness of your
union with Alexander Lyon should be permitted to
arise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, no!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how to silence such questions forever, how to legalize
your union and legitimatize your child—there is the
difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla moaned, but spoke no word in answer.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>“If I were to go now to Alick and tell him of your presence
in the house, and urge him to resign my hand and to
do you justice, he would not hear me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, he would not,” wailed Drusilla.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I were to appeal to my grandfather, the high-spirited
old soldier would—kick him out doors!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” gasped Drusilla, pierced more sharply by this
idea of prospective insult to her Alick than she could be by
any ignomy that might cover herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then what is to be done?” inquired Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing, nothing,” sighed Drusilla. “I wish I were
dead. I wish I were in Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but you see we can’t die just when the whim
seizes us; and if we could, we shouldn’t go to Heaven by
<i>that</i> means.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Heaven have mercy! have mercy on me, for my
state is desperate!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Drusilla, your state <i>is</i> desperate—desperate enough
to drive you to despair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Despair! I have lived in it for months. I shall die in
it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you do you will never see Heaven at all. For
despair is the last and most fatal of sins. But you needn’t
give up to it just yet!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what do you mean? What hope have I in this
world?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The hope that lasts as long as life. Listen, Drusilla.
I said that your state was desperate—not that your cause
was lost. ‘Desperate cases require desperate remedies.’
Your case is such a one, and my remedy is such a one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What remedy have you for me? However desperate,
however dangerous, I will not refuse it or shrink from it!
I would dare anything, suffer anything, to save my Alick
from his sin and win him back to me again!” said the
devoted wife, clasping her hands and gazing imploringly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>into the eyes of the lady who seemed now to hold her
destiny.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then attend to me, Drusilla, while I divulge my plan—the
<i>only</i> plan by which you can save your Alick from
present guilt and future remorse, and yourself and your
child from the greatest wrong and the deepest shame—the
only plan, Drusilla, by which you may hope to <span class='fss'>WIN YOUR
WAY</span>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speak on, tell me! I listen!” gasped Drusilla, in a
breathless voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, as I said before, Alexander Lyon is confidently
hoping to lead his bride before the minister this evening.
His hopes must be fulfilled—in you, Drusilla!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, in you! You must enact the bride this evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the name of Heaven, what is this that you are proposing
to me?” exclaimed Drusilla, gazing in wonder at
Miss Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That you shall take my place in this evening’s solemn
farce and be fast married to your husband, if you never
were before,” said Anna, calmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Impossible, Miss Lyon! He would reject me at first
sight, and I!—I should die of mortification!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, if he should be permitted to recognize you, he
might reject you. But he is not to be favored with a sight
of your face until he is irrecoverably bound to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even then he would renounce me—renounce me with
maledictions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, let him! I should thank him for freeing me, if I
were you. Why should you care, so that his great wrong
to you and to his child is righted—so that your good name
is redeemed from unmerited reproach, and your innocent
child from undeserved shame? After you are fast married—let
him go, if he will, say I!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Lyon! Miss Lyon! I never deceived any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>one in all my life! Shall I begin by deceiving my dear
Alick?” she said, wringing her poor little hands again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla, this will be no deception, but a pious fraud—if
ever there was such a thing in the world!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Lyon, you mean well; but I could not practise
this ‘pious fraud’ upon any one, least of all upon my
dear Alick! I could not, Miss Lyon, I could not!” fervently
exclaimed the loyal young creature, tightly clasping
her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you accept the dishonor to which he has doomed
you, rather than clear your fame in the manner I propose?”
said Anna, curling her lovely lip.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes Miss Lyon, yes; rather than force myself in this
way upon my dear Alick, if I have really no right to his
name, I will accept the undeserved shame,” said Drusilla,
sadly but firmly, while the devotion of a young martyr
glowed through her beautiful pale face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna nodded her head two or three times, and then
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“So be it. You may have the right to immolate yourself
upon this idolatrous altar of your inordinate affections.
But who I pray you, young mother, who gave you the right
to doom your innocent unborn child, your poor little helpless
child, to the deep degradation of illegitimacy?” demanded
Miss Lyon, solemnly fixing her eyes upon the face
of Drusilla, and seeing her mouth tremble and the big tears
roll, bead-like, down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush! oh, in pity, hush, Miss Lyon! Do not speak
of this!” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I must and will speak of it!” persisted Anna, who
now discovered that she had touched a chord in Drusilla’s
heart, through which she might draw her into the proposed
plan.</p>

<p class='c011'>And though the poor, wronged girl wept and wrung her
hands, Miss Lyon persevered in pleading this cause,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>mercilessly setting before the young mother the shames and
woes that must attend her child through life, should she
persist in her present resolution.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, Anna gained her point.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the poor baby’s sake, I consent. Do with me as
you will,” said Drusilla, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is right. Come now and let me dress you. We
have taken up too much time in talking. We have very
little left. I expect every moment to hear that the minister
has arrived,” said Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>And she flew to the chamber door, and turned the key.</p>

<p class='c011'>And she quickly took off her bridal robes, and carefully
dressed Drusilla in them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she placed the wreath of orange blossoms on her
head, and laid the veil of white lace over all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There,” said Anna, giving her a pair of white kid-gloves,
“put these on while I dress as a bridesmaid—for
while you personate Miss Lyon, I must seem to be Miss
Seymour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just at that moment, some one rapped softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna flew to answer the summons.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what is wanted now?” she inquired, without
opening the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, Miss, the Reverend Dr. Barbar have come,
and Mr. Alick and Mr. Dick is both waitin’; and Master’s
compliments, and is you and Miss Annie ready to come
down?” spoke the voice of Marcy from without.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, we are not quite ready yet, but we soon shall be.
Miss Annie is dressing. Ask them to come for us in about
fifteen minutes,” said Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>She then hurried to her wardrobes and bureaus, selected
from her large outfit of clothing a white taffeta-silk dress,
and a large white tulle veil, and quickly and carefully
disguised herself in them. So much dispatch did she use
that she, as well as Drusilla, was ready and waiting full five
minutes before the summons came for them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>“Courage now, my dear child! Remember how much is
at stake, how much depends upon your self-possession.
Draw your veil closely over your face. I will do the same
with mine. They will ascribe this to our bashfulness.
You must take Alick’s arm, I shall take Dick’s. Never
mind if your hands tremble or your tongue falters—it will
seem natural. Come now!” whispered Anna to her
agitated companion, as she led her to the chamber door and
opened it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alick and Dick stood outside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My adored Anna, this is the happiest moment of my
existence!” gallantly whispered Alick, as he took the half-offered
hand of Drusilla, pressed it fervently to his lips, and
drew it within his arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>She bowed in silence. It seemed all that was expected
of a bride under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Seymour, I believe? Yes? Well, I am very glad
to meet you again, Miss Annie, especially on this auspicious
occasion,” said Dick, bending low over the hand of
Anna, and then drawing it within his own and leading her
after the bride and bridegroom who were walking before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick,” whispered Anna, “are we both well disguised?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excellently,” returned Mr. Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you partially darken the room by putting out two
thirds of the lights?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I nearly quite darkened it by putting out three quarters
of them. I had a good opportunity of doing it, being alone
in the drawing-room while Alick and the parson were
closeted with the governor. He—the governor I mean—swore
a few at the servants when he came down by himself
to see that all was right. But the servants all declared
ignorance of the cause of the lights going out, and as it was
too late to remedy the evil he did not attempt it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks, Dick. And now you understand my purpose;
have you confidence in me?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>“In your sincerity, <i>yes</i>: but in your success, <i>no</i>. I tremble
for you, Anna, lest when all is done you should find
yourself fast married to Alick. I do, indeed, Anna!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How foolish of you, Dick. Why, I burned the
license.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know you did, Anna; but—I wish you would keep
as far as possible from the side of Alick Lyon when he stands
before a minister who holds a prayer-book in his hands open
at the marriage service!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be at ease, Dick, I shall place Alick’s wife between me
and him. I shall consider her an insurmountable obstacle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, Anna, we must not talk more! we are too
near them,” whispered Dick, in a very low tone as they
came up very close behind the foremost couple.</p>

<p class='c011'>And what were Drusilla’s feelings when she found herself
again by her Alick’s side, her hand drawn closely within
his protecting arm, and pressed frequently against his
beating heart—knowing, as she did, that he was then meditating
against her the deepest wrong man could inflict
upon woman—feeling, as she did, that every caress bestowed
upon her, in his ignorance of her identity, was intended for
another; and going, as she was, to take from him, by a
holy stratagem, those sacred rights of which he had so
cruelly deprived her; and to brave and bear his terrible
anger when that stratagem should be discovered, as it must
be when the rites should be over—what were her feelings?</p>

<p class='c011'>A great medical philosopher has written that “Nature is
before art with her anesthetics.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Drusilla’s present state was an illustration of this.
In the supreme crisis of her fate she scarcely realized her
position. She was like one partially overcome by ether or
chloroform; her head was ringing, her senses whirling, her
reason tottering; she went on as a somnambulist, half conscious
of her state, but unable to awake. It may be doubtful
whether she would now have retreated if she could; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>it is quite certain that she <i>could not</i> have done so even if
she would. She was under a potent spell that hurried her
forward with all the irresistible force of destiny.</p>

<p class='c011'>The drawing-room doors were thrown open. The little
bridal procession passed in.</p>

<p class='c011'>The room, thanks to Dick, was very dimly lighted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon the rug, with his back to the fire, and facing the
advancing party, stood the officiating clergyman in his surplice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near him was the grand and martial figure of the veteran
soldier, General Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>At a respectful distance stood a group of the old family
servants.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bridal party come on and formed before the minister—Alexander
and Drusilla stood together in the center; on
Alexander’s right stood Richard, on Drusilla’s left stood
Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>All were reverently silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>At a signal from General Lyon; Richard Hammond put
the envelope supposed to contain the license and the fee
into the hands of the minister, who merely, as a matter of
form, glanced over it and then opened his book and began
the sacred rite by reading the solemn exhortation with
which they commence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old, loving servants, who had hitherto kept at a reverential
distance from their masters, now drew as near the
scene of action as they dared do, so that they might hear
every syllable of the ceremony that was to unite, as they
supposed, their young mistress to the husband of her choice.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the minister, in the course of his reading, came to
these awful words—awful at least, to one of the contracting
parties, he delivered them with great effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘If any man can show just cause, why these may not
be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter forever
hold his peace.’”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>The minister made the usual formal pause, for the answer
that might often come, but never does; and then, with the
most solemn emphasis, he addressed the pair before him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I require and charge <i>you</i>, <span class='fss'>BOTH</span>, as ye will answer at
the dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets of all
hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of <i>you</i> know any
impediment, why you may not be lawfully joined together
in matrimony ye do now confess it. For be ye well assured,
that if any persons are joined together, otherwise than
God’s Word doth allow, their marriage is not lawful.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the minister read this dread adjuration, the face of
the bridegroom was observed to flush and pale, and his form
to tremble and shake as with a sudden ague fit.</p>

<p class='c011'>But though the minister made the customary pause, no
one spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the ceremony proceeded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Alexander, wilt thou have this woman to be thy
wedded wife?’” et cetera.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the bridegroom answered in a firm and almost defiant
voice:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘<span class='sc'>I will.</span>’”</p>

<p class='c011'>The clergyman continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Anna, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband?’”
and so forth.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the bride, Anna Drusilla, faltered in whispering
tones:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘<i>I will.</i>’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?’”
was the next question in the ritual.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I do,’” answered the sonorous voice of old General
Lyon, as he came forward, took the hand of the bride and
placed it in that of the minister.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the brave old soldier stepped back and turned
away his head, to hide the tears that filled those eyes which
had never quailed in the battle’s deadliest brawl; though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>they wept now, at his giving away, as he supposed the last
darling of his old age.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the minister was now joining the hands of the pair
before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>And bridegroom and bride, in their turn plighted their
troth each to the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alick uttered his vows in the firm and rather defiant
tones in which he had made all his responses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna Drusilla breathed hers in murmurs low as the softest
notes of the Æolian harp.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the ring was given and received.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last prayers were said; the benediction was given,
and the pair was pronounced to be man and wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander turned gaily and gallantly to salute his bride.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Lyon, as bridesmaid, lifted the veil.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the faithless husband stood face to face with the
forsaken wife!</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘<span class='sc'>Drusilla!!</span>’”</p>

<p class='c011'>He uttered but that one word, and reeled backward,
white and ghastly, as if stricken by death.</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla stood pale and mute her head sunk upon her
bosom, her hands hanging by her side.</p>

<p class='c011'>The parson, in his panic, dropped his prayer-book, and
stood gazing in consternation.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon bent forward in astonishment and perplexity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick was looking on in amusement.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Anna smiling in triumph.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>General Lyon was the first to break the ominous silence.
Turning to the bridegroom, he sternly demanded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir! what is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ask your beautiful grand-daughter, sir, who, doubtless,
to serve her own pleasure, has lent herself to the basest
fraud ever practised upon a man,” answered Alexander, now
livid with suppressed rage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old gentleman looked gravely upon the laughing
face of Anna, and inquired, sadly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is this that you have done, my child?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Lyon hesitated and looked confused.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray, my dear sir,” said Dick Hammond, taking advantage
of the pause and advancing to her rescue, “let <i>me</i>
explain this humiliating affair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So <i>you</i> were in it, were you?” fiercely exclaimed Alexander
confronting Richard. “All right! here is <i>one</i>, at least
whom I can and will call to a severe account.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am quite ready,” coolly replied Dick, “to admit and
answer for my share in this matter!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick! hold your tongue! How dare you, sir? This
is <i>my</i> thunder! And if you open your mouth again without
leave, I’ll—discard you forever! Stand back, sir!” exclaimed
Anna, with her blue eyes blazing upon the offender.</p>

<p class='c011'>He retreated as from before a fire, and stood laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear grandfather,” said Anna, turning towards the
veteran soldier, “this is solely <i>my</i> affair. May I speak
without interruption?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>“Yes, Miss Lyon,” answered the old gentleman, with
grave dignity, “I wait to hear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, sir, in a very few words, I will resolve the whole
mystery. You must know that at the time Mr. Alexander
Lyon sought the hand of your grand-daughter, he had
already a living wife, or one who believed herself to be
so!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is false!” burst forth from Alexander’s livid lips—“as
false as——! My cousin has been deceived!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is as true as truth! I will prove it to be so!” put
in Richard Hammond.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick! what did I tell you? If you speak again, I will
have you turned out!” exclaimed Anna, who was most
anxious to prevent a collision between the two young men.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He had a wife living and sought your hand?” exclaimed
the gallant old soldier, slowly turning his eyes from
Anna to Alick, and back again. “My child, you must mistake.
Such were the act of a scoundrel, and none such ever
bore the name of Lyon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir!” cried Alexander, in a voice thrilled and a countenance
agonized by shame—“Sir, hear me, hear one word
of my defence before you utterly condemn me! I do not
any more than yourself, understand this strange scene,
which seems to have been got up as a very bad joke against
me. But—that my name <i>is</i> Lyon should be an all-sufficient
guarantee that I am no scoundrel, and quite incapable of
seeking to wed one woman while legally bound to another.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is a denial, not a defence,” coldly replied General
Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, sir,” said Alexander, withdrawing a few paces
from the group and signaling to General Lyon to follow
him—“I have to confess to somewhat of human frailty in
order to exculpate myself from the charge of crime.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go on, sir,” curtly commanded the old gentleman, who
had come to his side.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>Poor Drusilla had lifted her head, which had rested upon
the bosom of Anna, and bent slightly forward to hear her
fate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you proceed, sir?” sternly inquired the General,
seeing that his nephew hesitated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is an unpleasant story to tell. But lest you should
have cause to think worse of me than I deserve, I must
admit that the young person here present was my companion
for a few months of youthful hallucination; but
there was no marriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Oh, Alick! Alick! Oh! Alick! my Alick!</i>” impulsively
burst from the pale lips of Drusilla with a low, long
drawn wail of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Anna once more put her arms around the feeble
form, and drew the bowed head down upon her supporting
bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir, what then?” severely demanded the
General.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must admit,” said Alexander, with a flushed brow,
and with some compunction awakened by the voice of her
whom he had once loved, and with much shame at having
to make the confession—“I must admit that, though there
really was none, yet the poor girl supposed there was a
marriage, since there was a semblance of one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, sir!” thundered the grand old soldier, “deceive
a maiden with the ‘semblance’ of a marriage and call yourself
a Lyon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Again you mistake me, sir!” cried Alexander, a hot
blush rushing over his face. “I also believed at the time
it was performed that the ceremony which united us was a
legal one. I continued to believe so, even after the hallucination
which led to the false and fatal step had passed
away—continued to believe so until last March, when I
chanced to discover that by the accidental omission of an
important form my marriage with this girl was illegal.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>“And of course, sir, having discovered such an error, you
took the earliest opportunity of rectifying it and making
your marriage legal?” said General Lyon, emphatically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, sir! have I not told you that the illusion which
lured me to the folly of such a misalliance was past and
gone? No, sir, I was too happy to be free to retrieve my
errors, and to come back, as in duty bound, to my first love
and first faith,” said Alexander, turning and bowing deeply
to Anna, who drew herself proudly erect and bent upon him
a look of ineffable contempt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Oh, Alick, my Alick!</i>” breathed Drusilla, in an almost
expiring voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, dear child, hush! Don’t you see and hear that
he is utterly beneath your love and regret?” whispered
Miss Lyon, tenderly drawing the young bowed head upon
her shoulder and pressing the poor broken heart to her
bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Proceed, sir!” said General Lyon, scowling darkly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is little more to say but this,” muttered Alexander,
in an intensely mortified and irritated tone. “From
the moment in which I discovered the illegality of my union
with this girl, of course I broke with her—not harshly, but
very gently. From that moment I treated her only as a
sister, and visited her with less and less frequency until I
ceased altogether. Until this hour, I assure you, my dear
sir, I had not seen this girl for months, in fact not since
April last. I meant never to see her again, but I took
measures to provide handsomely for her future support.
Such, my dear uncle, is the ‘head and front of my offending’—a
boyish error, heedlessly fallen into, deeply repented
of and eagerly atoned for. It is seldom that a young man’s
follies are so cruelly exposed as mine have been this evening,”
added Alexander, with an injured air.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And this is your explanation?” haughtily demanded
the General.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>“It is. For the girl’s sake I would willingly have concealed
the circumstance; but in the present state of affairs
I deemed the explanation due to yourself as well as to my
lovely cousin,” replied Alexander, again turning with a
bow to Anna, who again flashed back upon him a look of
fiery scorn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how comes this unhappy young woman here,
sir?” severely inquired General Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg to refer that question to the young woman herself,
or to her two confederates, Miss Lyon and Mr. Hammond,”
replied Alexander, making a sweeping bow that
included the whole circle, and then stepping back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How came this hapless young creature here, Anna?”
questioned the old man, turning to his grand-daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Permit me, if you please, to answer,” said Richard
Hammond, coming forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick! be silent! If you speak again till I bid you, I
will never speak to <i>you</i> again! This is <i>my</i> thunder, I tell
you, and you have nothing to do with it. Grandpa, order
him to be still!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be quiet, Richard. Proceed, Anna!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then listen, sir. You must know that this poor child,
living alone in the isolated country house where her husband
had immured her, suspected nothing of his wicked
addresses to me until the day before yesterday, when suddenly
she received authentic information—no matter from
whom——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was from——” began Richard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold you tongue, Dick! She received authentic information,
I say, of his intended marriage with me. Believing
herself as I believe her to be, his wife in law, as she is in
right, and wishing to save him from the sin he meditated and
the punishment she feared would be its consequence, willing
also to save me from the precipice of ruin upon which I
unconsciously stood, this young fragile creature, notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>her delicate health and broken heart, all unfit as
she was to travel, came by stage-coach the whole distance
from Washington to Saulsburg, and finding no conveyance
there, walked all the way through this dreadful weather on
this dark night, over the worst roads in the country, from
Saulsburg to this house. She came to me in my chamber,
privately told me her story, shielding her faithless husband
as much as she could; and she besought me to withdraw
from the marriage, and save him from guilt and myself
from fatal wrong.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then why has she attempted to force herself upon me
in this shameless manner? And why have you aided and
abetted her in the fraud?” fiercely demanded Alexander,
his temper impetuously breaking through all his efforts to
maintain a proud composure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna disdained to reply to him. Not one syllable would
she condescend to address to Alexander Lyon. But turning
again to her grandfather she said——</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drusilla did not do so; she will never attempt to force
herself upon Mr. Lyon. The young wife came, as I said,
to save him from committing a felony, and me from taking a
fatal step; and not to force herself upon an unwilling husband.
It will be well for him, when he shall come to himself,
if he can by any means, woo her back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How happened it, then, my child?” inquired the
General.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was I, who for reasons that will be apparent, urged
her to assume my dress and take my place in the wedding
ceremony, and thus win back the sacred rights of which
she had been so basely cheated!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But—still—how was this to be done in such a way,
my dear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By rectifying in this second marriage the informality
that rendered the first one illegal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I contend,” burst forth Alexander, “that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>second marriage is no more legal than the first one was;
<i>less</i> so, if anything! for this is an imposture, a substitution
of one person for another, besides being quite as irregular
as the first marriage in the same particular of lacking a
license!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He mistakes, my dear grandfather, there was a license,”
said Anna, quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; a license authorizing the marriage of Alexander
and Anna Lyon. Such was the document placed in the
hands of the minister!” angrily exclaimed Alick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I <i>beg</i> his pardon,” said Anna, still looking at, still
speaking to her grandfather. “The license of which <i>he</i>
speaks I burned with my own hands this evening. The
license of which <i>I</i> speak duly authorizes the nuptial rites to
be solemnized between Alexander Lyon and Anna Drusilla
Sterling, and it is now in the possession of the minister.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was then taken out by somebody else in my name.
It can be of no sort of legal effect,” cried Mr. Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Again I entreat his forgiveness; but this one was procured
by Alexander Lyon himself, dear grandpa.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is <span class='fss'>FALSE</span>!—I mean it is a mistake, Anna!” exclaimed
Alexander, correcting himself. “I procured no
such paper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fancy that he has forgotten the circumstance, dear
sir; but I will refresh his memory!” replied Anna. Then
turning to the sorely embarrassed minister who had stood
all this time an unwilling witness to this painful scene, she
added: “Dr. Barbar, will you have the goodness to return
the envelope handed you by Mr. Hammond?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The good clergyman complied. Anna opened the envelope,
and took from it its enclosure, which she handed to
General Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old gentleman put on his spectacles to examine it.
Having silently read it, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, this is—this is exactly what you represent it to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>be, my dear Anna! But it bears date—Heaven bless my
soul, of last January!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander started and turned ghastly pale, reeled, and
recovered himself by a great effort.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is this, my Anna? What does it all mean, my
dear?” inquired the old soldier.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander, putting a strong constraint upon himself,
bent forward to hear the answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It means this, my dear sir: You heard Mr. Lyon say
that at the time of his first marriage with this fair child he
supposed the union to be perfectly legal; but that afterwards
he chanced to discover that through ‘the accidental omission
of an important form,’ that ceremony to have been quite
invalid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes! yes!” said General Lyon, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He had some reason for what he said. Listen, dear
sir: When this man first prevailed over this poor child to
intrust herself to his care, he seems to have meant honestly
by her. He procured this license for their marriage; and
he took her before a regularly ordained minister of the
church. But by some strange oversight he never handed
the license to the minister, who, being a Northern man and
a new comer into Virginia, and ignorant of the law of the
State which required a license to be shown before a marriage
ceremony could be legally solemnized, never asked to see
the document, but married them, as he would have done in
his own State, without it. Months later Mr. Lyon discovered
this oversight, and having tired of his fair bride, he
resolved to profit by it in freeing himself from his obligations
to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so this is the license he took out for his first marriage,
but never used?” inquired General Lyon, who for
the last few moments had maintained a wonderful composure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>“But how came it into your possession?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, the poor child found it among her husband’s papers,
and cherished it with a fond superstition, as she cherished
her wedding-ring. When she came to me with her piteous
story she put that piece of paper into my hands as a proof
that she was no impostor. I saw at once how it might be
used to get her rights, especially as her first Christian name,
like mine, is Anna. So I burned my own license and substituted
hers and closed the envelope, which you, dear sir,
unconscious of its contents, delivered into Dick’s charge to
be handed to the minister. Then, using such arguments as
I thought must prevail over a wife and a Christian, I persuaded
Drusilla to take my place, as I said. And now I am
happy to announce that through my means, and mine only,
the omission of that important form in Drusilla’s first marriage
ceremony has been supplied in the second, and that
she is now unquestionably the lawful wife of Alexander
Lyon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Drusilla lifted her head from Anna’s supporting bosom,
and looked at her husband where he stood, enraged, baffled
and covered with confusion. Then she left Anna’s sheltering
arms and went towards him, and with outstretched
hands, face pale as death, and beseeching eyes, she pleaded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alick! Alick love! it was not for myself! it was
not for myself I did this! Oh Alick! try to pardon me,
dear! and I will pray to die and set you free!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And as if no one had been present but themselves, she
sank at his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Begone!</span>” cried Alexander, furiously stamping,
and turning away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir! you have disgraced yourself and the name you
bear!” sternly exclaimed General Lyon, stooping and
raising the poor little fallen figure, and supporting it on his
arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Alexander was absolutely beside himself with fury.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>Forgetting that he stood in the presence of old age and
young womanhood, forgetting that he was a man and a
gentleman, he strode towards his heart-broken wife, and
with livid face, starting eyes and brandishing hand, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“How dared you do this thing? How dared you bring
me to this open shame? How dared you brave me thus?
How dared you, I demand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not speak; but with clasped hands and uplifted
eyes, seemed to implore his forbearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have repaid years of kindness by the blackest ingratitude;
you have deceived me by the most infamous
treachery; you have sought your object by the basest
fraud; you have ventured to take the place of the lady I
loved and wished to wed, and so, stolen my hand by the
meanest trick! I asked you where you found the effrontery
to do all this?” he demanded, grinding his teeth with
rage and shaking his hand over her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still she uttered no word in her defence; but still with
appealing hands and eyes, mutely besought his mercy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick, who had been champing and stamping, and held
in leash only by Anna, during this assault, now utterly
broke bounds, and cried out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come come, Lyon! I’m blest if I’ll stand by and see a
lady brow-beaten so, if it is by her husband! If you don’t
stop this instantly, I’ll——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be quiet, Richard Hammond, and let the man speak to
his wife,” said General Lyon authoritatively, with covert
irony, as he laid his hand on Dick and held him back.</p>

<p class='c011'>Richard yielded, seeing in this unnatural forbearance of
the old soldier, only the ominous calm that portends the
fiercest storm.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, as for Alexander Lyon, so absorbed was he by his
own raging passions, that he perceived nothing of this bye-scene.
Still brandishing his hand above her drooping
head, he continued to pour out his wrath upon his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>“You never loved me! You never loved any one but
yourself! You never loved me, certainly, or you never
would have betrayed me in this base manner,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her white lips quivered—parted, but only inarticulate
murmurs issued from them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But do not flatter yourself, girl, that your treachery
shall serve your purpose. Such a marriage, so procured,
can never stand in law. And here, in the presence of these
witnesses, I utterly refuse to acknowledge its validity, or to
recognize you as my wife! Here, I renounce you forever!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her pleading hands were lifted in an agony of deprecation,
and then dropped by her side, in despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had you accepted the position I gave you, although I
should never have seen your face again, yet I would have
provided handsomely for your support. But now, since you
have put this foul deception upon me, for all the help you
can get from me, you may—<span class='fss'>PERISH</span>!” he hissed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not so,” said the fine old gentleman, General Lyon,
drawing the arm of the outraged and half crushed young
creature, closer within his own. “Not so, by your leave.
I charge myself with the care of <i>my niece</i>, Mrs. Alexander
Lyon. Her home shall be <i>here</i>, with my grand-daughter
and myself—<i>here</i>, where she shall live in peace and safety—loved
and honored, until such times as you—madman!—shall
come to your senses, and sue more humbly for the
forgiveness of the wronged wife, than you ever did for the
love of the unhappy maiden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You had better be quite sure that the girl in your arm
<i>is</i> a wife before you offer her the protection of your roof
and the society of your grand-daughter!” sneered Alexander,
bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, you have struck the last blow to your own honor
and my patience. Alexander Lyon, if you were not the son
of my dead brother I would curse you where you stand!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>But go!” said the old man, lifting, up and stretching out
his arm with an imperious gesture. “Leave this house,
and never desecrate its halls again with your presence!
and never again let me see your face!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Cursing and stamping with fury, Alexander turned and
flung himself from the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the hall outside his voice was heard calling loudly to
his servant to put his horses to his carriage and bring it
around to the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon gazed down upon the poor young wife at
his side, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look up my child. Here is your home and your father
and your sister. Be of good comfort, trust in God, and all
will be well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She answered nothing, but sunk heavily within his aged
arms, that yet were quite strong enough to support her
sinking form. She had succumbed to one of those fainting
fits which, through the agonies she had so long endured,
had now become habitual to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Grandpa, she has swooned! Marcy, come here quickly.
You are strong; help to carry her to the sofa. Matty, go
to the spare room opposite mine and turn down the bed;
see to the fire, and come back and tell me when all is
ready,” exclaimed Anna, rapidly issuing her orders, while
she hastily took off Drusilla’s bridal wreath and veil, and
unloosened her dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Marcy who had been in the group of servants assembled
to witness the marriage ceremony, was quickly on the spot,
and with her assistance Anna bore the insensible form of
Drusilla to the sofa and laid her on it.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon followed, looking anxiously upon the pale
face of the sufferer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Barbar and Mr. Hammond were left standing on the
rug, and for the time being, forgotten by their host and
hostess.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>All available means were used to revive the swooning
girl, but all in vain. Anna bathed her face with eau de
cologne, and applied strong smelling salts to her nose; and
Marcy smartly slapped her hands, but without effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>While they were thus engaged Matty entered the drawing-room,
and announced that the bed-chamber was ready.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must take her there and undress her and put her
to bed, Mercy; and then we shall have a better opportunity
of applying restoratives,” said Miss Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Miss, for it’s little we can do here,” admitted
Marcy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear grandpa,” said Anna, addressing the old gentleman,
who still stood watching with interest the face of the
patient, “dear grandpa, you have been so worried this evening.
Do sit down and rest and order some refreshment
for yourself and for Dr. Barbar and Dick, who are being
neglected. I shall take Drusilla to the Rose Room and see
that every proper attention is given her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But she seems to be dead or dying,” said General
Lyon, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, dear sir; she is only in a swoon, which is very
natural under all the circumstances; but not at all dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope you are certain of this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite certain, sir. Now, Marcy, help me to lift her,”
said Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Dick Hammond, who heard and saw all that was
going on, hastened forward to offer his services as bearer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna, do let me carry her up stairs. I can do so
with so much more ease to her than you and Marcy could,”
he said. And without waiting for leave, he tenderly raised
the unconscious form and gently bore it after Marcy, who
led the way up to the Rose Room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna bade good night to Dr. Barbar, and then turned
and kissed her grandfather and asked for his usual blessing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>“God bless you, my dear child, for you have done a
righteous deed this night. Take care of the poor desolate
girl upstairs, and if I can be of any service to her, do not
hesitate to call on me, even if you should have to wake me
up in the night. My house, my purse, and myself, Anna,
are at her orders no less than at yours, as long as she has
wants and I have means,” answered the grand old man, as
he pressed a kiss upon his child’s brow and dismissed her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna hurried up stairs and met Dick on the landing.
He had just deposited his charge on her couch and left her
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hallelujah, Dick!” exclaimed Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hallelujah, Anna!” responded Dick, as their hands
met in a hearty, congratulatory clasp.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is all right with us now, Anna?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All quite right now, Dick, darling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick looked gratefully and then pleadingly in her face, as
he took her hand again and gently drew her towards him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she laughingly broke away, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not now, Dick; not now, darling. I must go to my
patient. We must not neglect that poor girl, to whom we
owe all our happiness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed we must not,” earnestly agreed Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then good night, Dick. I will see you in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good night, my liege lady. But stay. If I can be of
any use, pray command me at any hour of the day or
night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That I will, Dick. Once more good night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Anna flitted past him and went into the Rose
Room.</p>

<p class='c011'>There she found that Marcy and Matty had already
divested Drusilla of her bridal robes and clothed her in a
loose white wrapper and put her comfortably to bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>They now stood one on each side rubbing her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>“How is she?” inquired Anna, approaching and bending
over the pallid face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No change yet, Miss; but we must be patient and keep
up this friction, and she will come to presently,” answered
Marcy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna went into her own chamber and quickly changed
her splendid dress for a wadded white merino wrapper, and
then returned to the sick chamber, and took her place beside
the bed, saying;</p>

<p class='c011'>“Matty, you may retire to rest. Marcy and myself will
remain here to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Matty who was yawning fearfully, gladly availed herself
of the permission and left the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Miss Lyon willingly, gratefully, undertook the long
night’s watch over the suffering young creature to whose
almost incredible energy and heroism she owed her own
preservation from a fatal marriage and her hopes of happiness
with the man she loved.</p>

<p class='c006'>The great old-fashioned hall clock was striking the
quarter before twelve when Richard Hammond re-entered
the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>He found General Lyon and Dr. Barbar still there,
seated in large arm-chairs each side of the fire-place.
They seemed to be discussing the events of the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, old friend, my dog of a nephew, like that other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>grand rascal of old, has ‘spoiled the feast, broke the good
meeting, with, most admired disorder,’” sighed the general.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, my dear sir, he is young, and we must be
charitable. Even David, the man after the Lord’s own
heart, had to pray that the sins of his youth might not be
remembered against him. Give the young man time to
recollect himself and to reform. But I feel very sorry for
the poor wife—she seems but a mere child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is but sixteen or seventeen,” said General Lyon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah dear, how sad! She seems to love him much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She loves a villain then, and must suffer accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will he never be reconciled to her, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can she ever be reconciled to <i>him</i>? That is the
question. ‘My spirit shall not always strive with man,’
saith the Lord. And if the Divine Spirit wearies of the
fruitless struggle with Evil, how much sooner shall the
human spirit sink? For myself, I should not wonder if
she should experience such a revulsion of feeling as should
make the very thought of that man hateful to her. But in
any case her home is here, under our protection, until such
time as he shall repent and show himself worthy to reclaim
her hand, if that time ever should come. Ah! here is
Dick. How did you leave our young charge, my boy?”
inquired the general, for the first time conscious of
Richard’s presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I left her in good hands, sir; otherwise much as she
was when taken from this room. I understand, sir, that
since her domestic sufferings commenced she has been
very subject to these fainting fits. They are said to
be not dangerous; but for my part, I should think there
was reason to fear that her heart is affected,” answered
Richard, seeking a seat between the two old gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dick, you were more engaged in this exposure of Alexander
than Anna was willing to admit. You knew of his
previous marriage before you came down here?” inquired
the general.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>“Yes, sir; but only a few days before; and I came down
here for the express purpose of divulging it to you; and I
brought with me the minister who performed the first ceremony,
as proof of it. But before I saw you I chanced to
meet Anna, who proposed to me another plan, which I
thought to be a better one than my own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Anna’s plan was assuredly the only one by which
the ends of justice could be reached in this singular case.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I tell you, sir, how I came to be informed of the
first marriage?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh no, Dick, not to-night—to-morrow. Gentlemen, it
is on the stroke of midnight. And though my sorry
nephew has ‘spoiled the feast,’ et cetera, I see no reason
why we should watch and fast the night through. We will
have supper and then to bed. And although you are the
only wedding guests, we will adjourn to the banqueting
room,” said General Lyon, arising and leading the way to
a brilliantly lighted and elegantly decorated saloon, where a
sumptuous supper was laid out.</p>

<p class='c011'>The host led his two guests to the upper end of the
table, and invited them to be seated.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two Jacobs, father and son, stood ready to wait on
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>But what took away their appetites—whether it was the
excitement of the evening, or the dreariness of a rich repast
laid for many, and honored with the presence of but three;
or the embarrassing variety of delicacies spread before them,
is uncertain; but they could not eat. A broken biscuit and
a glass of wine, was all that each took. And then, with
mutual good nights and good wishes, they separated.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon went to rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Jacob showed Dr. Barbar to the best vacant bedroom,
and young Jacob led Dick Hammond to the second
best.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is to be hoped that the two old gentlemen slept well.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>Dick did not close his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The revulsion from despair to hope, to certainty of happiness,
was almost too much for him. He lay rolling and
tossing from side to side all night; telling himself over
and over again that it was no dream; that Anna was free;
and that he might at last be made happy with her hand;
and wondering how long it would be before he could coax
Anna to name the happy day, and his uncle to give them
his blessing. He heard the old hall clock strike every hour,
and thought the night would never come to an end.</p>

<p class='c011'>At four o’clock on that winter morning, it was still very
dark, when he heard rousing raps at his door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! who’s there?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s me, Master Dick,” answered the voice of Marcy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! what do you want?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please sir, Miss Anna——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick was out of bed in an instant, drawing on his pantaloons.</p>

<p class='c011'>—“Says how young Mrs. Lyon is seemingly ill, and will
you please to wake up the coachman, and tell him to take
the fastest horse and ride quick as possible to Saulsburg for
Dr. Leech.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick was dressed and at the door by the time Marcy had
done speaking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I see Miss Anna for an instant?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will ask her,” answered Marcy, hurrying down the
passage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick hastened after her, and waited outside Drusilla’s
door while Marcy went in to inquire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna came out with a large shawl wrapped around her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, hurry, Dick! don’t stop to talk! the poor child is
very ill, and delay may be her death!” exclaimed Anna, as
she appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I merely stopped to tell you, Anna, that I shall trust to
no servant, least of all to slow old Jacob! I shall saddle
my own fast horse, and fly for the doctor myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>“You’re a trump, Dick. Heaven bless you, be off?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Anna disappeared within the sick chamber. And
Dick ran down to the stable, saddled his horse, leaped upon
his back, struck spurs to his flanks and was off like an
arrow in the direction of Saulsburg. “He skelpit on
through dub and mire,” so eager in his errand, that he
scarcely noticed the storm was over, and the clouds were
breaking overhead; a few pale stars were shining out, and
day was faintly dawning in the East.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he came to the toll-gate, as once before, he cleared
the bar with a bound, and dashed onward, to the infinite
indignation of old Andy who had just opened his shutters
in time to witness the feat, and who turned to his old
wife, then busy over the fire cooking the breakfast, and
then exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh, Jenny, woman! the warlocks are flitting back frae
the witches’ Sabbath. There gaed are noo!—on a broomstick,
or something unco like it, right over the toll-gate bar
and awa’! We’ll hear the news the day, woman!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Heedless of what the guardian of the road might think
of him, Dick raced on, sending flakes of mud from his
horse’s heels.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun was rising behind the farthest range of mountains,
and sending his dazzling beams obliquely through the
Wild Gap and athwart the Wild River, as Dick rode into
Saulsburg and drew rein before the picturesque inn.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had not the slightest idea whereabouts in the village
or its neighborhood the country doctor lived.</p>

<p class='c011'>So he inquired of the hostler who came to take his horse:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know where Dr. Leech hangs out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dunno where he hangs out, sir; but you can ax him
hisself. He lives right down the street there, sir,” answered
the man, pointing to a small, neat cottage, with a still smaller
surgery beside it, and the name of “<span class='sc'>Leech</span>” over the
door.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>Dick left his horse and went and knocked up the doctor,
and, in a few urgent words, told him his services were instantly
needed at Old Lyon Hall, where there was a lady in
extremity, and entreated him to hasten immediately to her
relief.</p>

<p class='c011'>The good doctor needed no second bidding, but loudly
called to shop-boy and horse-boy to have his saddle-bags
and his horse got ready, and then rushed into the house to
put on his great-coat and hat.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Dick had seen the doctor fairly started on his journey,
he turned his steps to the little inn, entered it, and
ordered breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And have my horse well rubbed down and watered and
fed. I must mount him again in an hour,” he added.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this time of the day there always happened to be
more servants than guests at the “Foaming Tankard,”
and so Dick and his horse were both promptly served.</p>

<p class='c011'>But while Mr. Hammond sat enjoying the fragrant
coffee, light rolls, sweet butter, luscious ham and fresh
eggs that formed the repast, for which his early ride had
given him so keen an appetite, he was suddenly interrupted.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was “mammy” who burst in upon his privacy with
more haste than ceremony, demanding:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, sir, wasn’t you the gentleman as come
down with us in the night coach from Drainsville and
got off at Frostville?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes! and wasn’t you the lady that scalped me and
broke both my legs?” laughed Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope you surwived it, sir? But that wasn’t what
I comed to ax you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; having a good constitution, I got over it. But
what <i>did</i> you come to ask me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please, sir, no offence; but is it as the boys say, you
come from Old Lyon Hall this morning?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Arter a doctor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For a lady in ’streme ’stress?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Young Mrs. Lyon, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, sir, that was my own lady; and I jest knowed
how it would be! I jest did! Sir, she left here in an old
ramshackly concern as broke down with her afore she so
much as got a mile from the place; and then she up and
set out to walk all the way through the storm to the hall;
and which if I’d a knowed, I’d a seen the old hall and
everybody into it farther afore I’d a let her a risted of her
life by so doing. But that there blamed boy,—Lord forgive
me for swearing,—arter he’d upset her in the road,
took all the rest of the evening to haul off the old wreck
of a carriage, and never got back here till I had gone to
bed. So I never knowed nothing about it till this morning,
which a purty state my nerves has been in ever since.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And mammy, having talked herself out of breath,
dropped down in a chair and panted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were this lady’s nurse?” inquired Dick, buttering
a roll.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In course I was, sir; perfessionally so; and recommended
by the highest gentlemen of the physical persuasion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, my good woman, I wonder why your patient
didn’t take you along with her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So do I, sir. That was a very sensible remark of
yours; but you see, sir, she preferred to leave me here in
care of the baggidge, which I will say this—that mind
can’t conceive, nor tongue tell the trouble I’ve had to pertect
them there two little red morocky trunks from being
stoled or left behind!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>“True as I tell you, sir; so I don’t much wonder at the
madam wanting of me to stay behind to watch them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, nor I,” said Dick, slily. “But, my good woman,”
he added, “I think now that the best thing you can do is
to go to your mistress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which such is my intention so to do sir; and I would
be obliged to you if you would be so good as to speak to
that there pig-headed landlord—begging your pardon, sir,
but so he is—to let me have a decent horse and wagon, that
won’t break down, to take me and the baggidge to the old
hall, which, if you are going back there, sir, yourself, you
can show me the way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Dick, with good-natured alacrity, seeing at
once how important it might be that Drusilla should have
her nurse and her wardrobe. “Yes I will attend to it at
once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he arose and rang the bell, and told the waiter who
answered it to send the landlord to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The slow host came sauntering in with his hands in his
pockets, and in answer to Dick’s inquiries, deliberately
acknowledged that he had “such a thing,” and a bargain
was soon struck for a wagon, horse and driver to take
mammy and her luggage to Old Lyon Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the bill is not yet paid,” said the landlord, hesitatingly,
“and so I would rather keep a part of the luggage
for security until it is settled. One of the little trunks,
now, might do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Set you up with it, indeed!” fiercely exclaimed mammy,
as much ruffled as a hen when her nest is threatened.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But who’s to pay the bill?” pursued the host.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall,” answered Dick, coldly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No you won’t, sir, begging of your pardon; that
wouldn’t be noways proper. The young madam left her
port-munny long o’ me to settle all claims. Bring your
’count in here to me, mister landlord, and I’ll settle of it
myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>“And not to lose time while he is making it out you had
better go and get ready to start,” counselled Dick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So I had, sir; that’s another very sensible remark of
yours. And I’ll not keep you waiting one minute; I’ll be
ready as soon as the wagon is,” said the old woman, hurrying
out of the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in less than twenty minutes mammy reappeared
ready for her journey. The bill was paid, the wagon
brought around and loaded with the luggage, and the
nurse and the team started, escorted by Mr. Richard
Hammond on horseback, and cheered by all the ragamuffins
in the village.</p>

<p class='c011'>It does not take long after a storm is over for the water
to run off the roads of that region, which are high roads in
more senses than one; so the travel was not so bad as
might have been expected.</p>

<p class='c011'>In little more than two hours the “procession” arrived
at the toll-gate where old Andy was on duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh, sirs!” he exclaimed, on seeing Dick, “but ye’s a
braw callant! Wha gave ye commission to loup twice over
me bar, and cheat me of me toll? Eh, but ye’ll bide where
ye be till ye pay me for a’, e’en to the uttermost fearthing,
before I let ye by; for ye’s no jump your wagon over the
gate, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly, of course, all right. You see I was in too
great a hurry to stop to make change, or to wait to have
the gate opened when I passed here last night and early
this morning. But now open quickly to me. And here!
here is what will pay you for all the tolls and leave something
besides to buy a winter gown for the gudewife,”
said Dick, laughing, and tossing a ten dollar gold coin to
the old man. “And tell her this from me,” added the
kind-hearted fellow, “that the girl she took so much interest
in is quite safe and well cared for.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Andy was not concerned about the safety of the girl,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>he was stooping to pick up the gold eagle, and muttering to
himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eh! how the lad flings about his gowd, to be sure!
It’s weel a carefu’ body like mysel’ is nigh to gather it up.
What was you saying anent the young hizzy, sir?” he inquired,
looking up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell your good wife that she is safe and well cared for.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ou, ay! it wad be i’ some house o’ correction; only
there’s nae sic a useful institootion in the country,” growled
Andy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind where she is, or who she is. Tell your
wife she is all right!” said Dick, as he sauntered through
the gate in advance of the wagon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The worst part of the road was past, and so in something
less than an hour the “cortege” arrived at Old Lyon Hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor had been there already for some time, and he
was then with young Mrs. Lyon, who seemed to all around
her to be at the point of death.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the report of General Lyon, who immediately
rang for a woman servant to show the nurse up to her
patient.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I am very glad you thought to fetch her, Dick,”
added the honest old general.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick explained that such thoughtfulness was no merit of
his; that this woman had attended the young wife down
from Washington, and had been left temporarily at Saulsburg,
and had availed herself of his escort to come on to
the hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>So mammy was taken up to her patient, whom she found
much too ill to be scolded for her imprudence.</p>

<p class='c011'>In fact Drusilla was, as they said, almost at the point of
death. Her life hung upon the slenderest thread for five
days, at the end of which she became the mother of a beautiful
boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>As her illness before his birth had been severe and dangerous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>so her convalescence afterwards was slow and precarious.
For many more days she lay in a mental and physical
prostration, so profound that she was incapable of
noticing her child, and even of realizing its existence. But
her youth and her good constitution were very much in her
favor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gradually, very gradually, she came out of this depressed
state.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first signs of reviving life she gave was the interest
she showed in her babe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before she had strength to speak above her breath, or
sense to connect a sentence properly, she would mutely insist
upon having him laid on her arm and next her bosom;
and then with a serene smile she would sink into a tranquil
sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then, lest even the light weight of the infant should
be too much for her feeble strength, the nurse would steal
the sleeping child from the sleeping mother and lay him in
the pretty berceaunette that had been purchased and decorated
for him by Anna.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the weeks went on, the young mother continued to
revive; and her interest in her infant boy became a passionate
love, that grew with her growing strength.</p>

<p class='c011'>When she was able to be dressed and to recline in her
easy chair, she would sit hours with the babe clasped to her
bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Strangely enough, that female martinet, the monthly
nurse, never objected to this.</p>

<p class='c011'>And to all Anna’s remonstrances Drusilla would answer:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Lyon, you don’t know, you can’t know, what
this soft little form is to me, as I hold it to my bosom. It
is such a soothing balm—such a heavenly comfort.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes Anna would take an opportunity to speak to
mammy on the subject; but mammy would answer:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You let her alone, Miss. It’s all natur’ and all right.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>The baby’ll save her life. It’ll draw all the soreness out’n
her heart and heal it up; mind me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But suddenly the thought came to the young mother that
she was perhaps injuring her child by holding him in her
lap so constantly. And then all her conduct with it
changed. She would take him up only to nurse and get
him to sleep. And then she would lay him in his little
decorated cradle; but that cradle stood always by her side,
so that, sleeping or waking, her infant son was never out of
her sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was beautiful to see the interest that the old General
and his grand-daughter took in this young mother and
child.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Lyon visited Drusilla every morning, bringing
some rare offering of fruit ordered from the city, or flowers
from his own conservatory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna was seldom out of the chamber. Every forenoon
she took her needle-work and went to keep Drusilla company.</p>

<p class='c011'>And often they might be seen sitting, working together,
with the baby in the cradle between them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dick, in his enthusiasm, said of this group, that it was
“a sleeping cherub watched by two guardian angels.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Watched by guardian angels,” in her home of peace,
we will also leave the young, forsaken wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether Drusilla ever was re-united with her husband,
or whether Dick was ever really reclaimed from the clutches
of his “friends,” and rewarded with the hand of Anna,
will be duly related in the sequel to this book, which
will immediately appear, under the title of “<span class='sc'>The Brides’
Fate</span>.”</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
